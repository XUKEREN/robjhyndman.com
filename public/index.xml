      <description>Forecasting benchmarks are very important when testing new forecasting methods, to see how well they perform against some simple alternatives. Every week I get sent papers proposing new forecasting methods that fail to do better than even the simplest benchmark. They are rejected without review.
Typical benchmarks include the naïve method (especially for finance and economic data), the seasonal naïve method (for seasonal data), an automatically selected ETS model, and an automatically selected ARIMA model.</description>

      <description>Presentation to the New York R Meetup It is becoming increasingly common for organizations to collect very large amounts of data over time. Data visualization is essential for exploring and understanding structures and patterns, and to identify unusual observations. However, the sheer quantity of data available means that new time series visualisation methods are needed.
I will demonstrate an approach to this problem using a vector of features on each time series, measuring characteristics of the series.</description>

      <description>Presentation at the International Symposium on Forecasting, Boulder USA. The forecast package in R is widely used and provides good tools for monthly, quarterly and annual time series. But it is not so well-developed for daily and sub-daily data, and it does not interact easily with modern tidy packages such as dplyr, purrr and tidyr.
I will describe our plans and progress in developing a collection of packages to provide tidy tools for time series and forecasting, which will interact seamlessly with tidyverse packages, and provide functions to handle time series at any frequency.</description>

      <description>A crucial task in time series forecasting is the identification of the most suitable forecasting method. We present a general framework for forecast-model selection using meta-learning. A random forest is used to identify the best forecasting method using only time series features. The framework is evaluated using time series from the M1 and M3 competitions and is shown to yield accurate forecasts comparable to several benchmarks and other commonly used automated approaches of time series forecasting.</description>

      <title>A brief history of time series forecasting competitions</title>

      <description>Prediction competitions are now so widespread that it is often forgotten how controversial they were when first held, and how influential they have been over the years.
To keep this exercise manageable, I will restrict attention to time series forecasting competitions &amp;mdash; where only the history of the data is available when producing forecasts.
Nottingham studies The earliest non-trivial study of time series forecast accuracy was probably by David Reid as part of his PhD at the University of Nottingham (1969).</description>

      <description>Presentation for the Australian Bureau of Statistics I will provide an overview of some of my recent research on methods to deal with high-dimensional time series.
1. Visualizing many time series
It is becoming increasingly common for organizations to collect very large amounts of data over time. Data visualization is essential for exploring and understanding structures and patterns, and to identify unusual observations. However, the sheer quantity of data available challenges current time series visualisation methods.</description>

      <description>A popular approach to forecasting macroeconomic variables is to utilize a large number of predictors. Several regularization and shrinkage methods can be used to exploit such high-dimensional datasets, and have been shown to improve forecast accuracy for the US economy. To assess whether similar results hold for economies with different characteristics, an Australian dataset containing observations on 151 aggregate and disaggregate economic series as well as 185 international variables, is introduced.</description>

      <description>The M4 forecasting competition is well under-way, and a few of my PhD students have been working on submissions.
Pablo Montero-Manso, Carla Netto, and Thiyanga Talagala have made an R package containing all of the data (100,000 time series), which should make it substantially easier for other contestants to load the data into R in order to compute forecasts.
Grab the package from this github repository.

      <title>Anomaly detection in streaming nonstationary temporal data</title>
      <link>https://robjhyndman.com/publications/oddstream/</link>

      <guid>https://robjhyndman.com/publications/oddstream/</guid>
      <description>This article proposes a framework that provides early detection of anomalous series within a large collection of non-stationary streaming time series data. We define an anomaly as an observation that is very unlikely given the recent distribution of a given system. The proposed framework first forecasts a boundary for the system&amp;rsquo;s typical behavior using extreme value theory. Then a sliding window is used to test for anomalous series within a newly arrived collection of series.</description>

      <title>Optimal forecast reconciliation for hierarchical and grouped time series through trace minimization</title>

      <description>Large collections of time series often have aggregation constraints due to product or geographical groupings. The forecasts for the most disaggregated series are usually required to add-up exactly to the forecasts of the aggregated series, a constraint we refer to as &amp;ldquo;coherence&amp;rdquo;. Forecast reconciliation is the process of adjusting forecasts to make them coherent. The reconciliation algorithm proposed by Hyndman et al. (2011) is based on a generalized least squares estimator that requires an estimate of the covariance matrix of the coherency errors (i.</description>

      <title>Exploring the sources of uncertainty: why does bagging for time series forecasting work?</title>
      <link>https://robjhyndman.com/publications/bagging-uncertainty/</link>

      <description>In a recent study, Bergmeir, Hyndman and Benítez (2016) successfully employed a bootstrap aggregation (bagging) technique for improving the performance of exponential smoothing. Each series is Box-Cox transformed, and decomposed by Seasonal and Trend decomposition using Loess (STL); then bootstrapping is applied on the remainder series before the trend and seasonality are added back, and the transformation reversed to create bootstrapped versions of the series. Subsequently, they apply automatic exponential smoothing on the original series and the bootstrapped versions of the series, with the final forecast being the equal-weight combination across all forecasts.</description>

      <description>Visualization is a crucial component of data analysis. It is always a good idea to plot the data before fitting any models, making any predictions, or drawing any conclusions. As sensors of the electric grid are collecting large volumes of data from various sources, power industry professionals are facing the challenge of visualizing such data in a timely fashion. In this article, we demonstrate several data visualization solutions for big energy data through three case studies involving smart meter data, phasor measurement unit (PMU) data, and probabilistic forecasts, respectively.</description>

      <title>A note on the validity of cross-validation for evaluating autoregressive time series prediction</title>
      <link>https://robjhyndman.com/publications/cv-time-series/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://robjhyndman.com/publications/cv-time-series/</guid>
      <description>One of the most widely used standard procedures for model evaluation in classification and regression is $K$-fold cross-validation (CV). However, when it comes to time series forecasting, because of the inherent serial correlation and potential non-stationarity of the data, its application is not straightforward and often omitted by practitioners in favour of an out-of-sample (OOS) evaluation. In this paper, we show that in the case of a purely autoregressive model, the use of standard $K$-fold CV is possible as long as the models considered have uncorrelated errors.</description>

      <description>The official guidelines for the M4 competition have now been published, and there have been several developments since my last post on this.
 There is now a prize for prediction interval accuracy using a scaled version of the Mean Interval Score. If the $100(1-\alpha)$% prediction interval for time $t$ is given by $[L_{t},U_{t}]$, for $t=1,\dots,h$, then the MIS is defined as $$\frac{1}{h}\sum_{t=1}^{h} \left[ (U_t-L_t) + \frac{2}{\alpha}(L_t-Y_t)1(Y_t &amp;lt; L_t) + \frac{2}{\alpha}(Y_t-U_t)1(Y_t &amp;gt; U_t) \right] $$ where $Y_t$ is the observation at time $t$.</description>

      <description>Talk given at meeting of New Zealand Statistical Association and International Association for Statistical Computing (11-14 December 2017), Auckland, New Zealand.
It is always a good idea to plot your data before fitting any models, making any predictions, or drawing any conclusions. But how do you actually plot data on thousands of smart meters, each comprising thousands of observations over time? We cannot simply produce time plots of the demand recorded at each meter, due to the sheer volume of data involved.</description>

I would like to thank Rob, my friend and co-author, for his insightful remarks concerning the upcoming M4 competition. As Rob says, the two of us have talked a great deal about competitions and I certainly agree with him about the “ideal” forecasting competition. In this reply, I will explain why I have deviated from the “ideal”, mostly for practical reasons and to ensure higher participation.</description>

      <description>The &amp;ldquo;M&amp;rdquo; competitions organized by Spyros Makridakis have had an enormous influence on the field of forecasting. They focused attention on what models produced good forecasts, rather than on the mathematical properties of those models. For that, Spyros deserves congratulations for changing the landscape of forecasting research through this series of competitions.
Makridakis &amp;amp; Hibon, (JRSSA 1979) was the first serious attempt at a large empirical evaluation of forecast methods.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional smoothing of mortality surfaces with cohort and period ridges</title>

      <description>BACKGROUND
Mortality rates typically move smoothly over age and time. Exceptions occur, due to events such as wars and epidemics, which create, among other features, ridges in the mortality surface in a particular calendar year or for cohorts born in a particular year.
OBJECTIVES
We aim to develop and evaluate new methods that better model the smooth underlying age-period mortality surface and any cohort or period ridges.
METHODS
We propose two new practical methods for modelling the age-period surface of the logarithms of mortality rates.</description>

      <description>For a second year running, there will be another rOpenSci OzUnconference in Australia. This one will be held in Melbourne, on 26-27 October 2017.
Unlike regular conferences, there are no talks and there is no pre-determined agenda. It brings together scientists, developers, and open data enthusiasts from academia, industry, government, and non-profit to get together for a few days to work on R-related projects. The agenda is mostly decided during the conference itself, and involves participants dividing into small groups to work on the projects of most interest to them.</description>

Abstract
Time series can often be naturally disaggregated in a hierarchical or grouped structure. For example, a manufacturing company can disaggregate total demand for their products by country of sale, retail outlet, product type, package size, and so on. As a result, there can be millions of individual time series to forecast at the most disaggregated level, plus additional series to forecast at higher levels of aggregation.</description>

      <description>This paper describes a frame_calendar function that organizes and displays temporal data, collected on sub-daily resolution, into a calendar layout. Calendars are broadly used in society to display temporal information, and events. The frame_calendar uses linear algebra on the date variable to create the layout. It utilizes the grammar of graphics to create the plots inside each cell, and thus synchronizes neatly with ggplot2 graphics. The motivating application is studying pedestrian behavior in Melbourne, Australia, based on counts which are captured at hourly intervals by sensors scattered around the city.</description>

      <description>Talk to be given at International Symposium on Energy Analytics (22-23 June 2017), Cairns, Australia.
Standard time series analysis and visualization tools fail on smart metre data due to the sheer volume of available data (both in the time dimension and due to the large numbers of smart metres providing data). In addition, smart metre data is often messy, with missing observations, periods where some metres are offline, periods of relatively constant low level energy usage, occasional days of unusually high demand, and so on.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Probabilistic Forecasting of Electricity Demand with Smart Meter Data</title>

      <description>Electricity smart meters record consumption, on a near real-time basis, at the level of individual commercial and residential properties. From this, a hierarchy can be constructed consisting of time series of demand at the smart meter level, and at various levels of aggregation, such as substations, cities and regions. Forecasts are needed at each level to support the efficient and reliable management of consumption. A limitation of previous research in this area is that it considered only deterministic prediction.</description>

      <title>Coherent Probabilistic Forecasts for Hierarchical Time Series</title>

      <guid>https://robjhyndman.com/publications/probhts/</guid>
      <description>Many applications require forecasts for a hierarchy comprising a set of time series along with aggregates of subsets of these series. Although forecasts can be produced independently for each series in the hierarchy, typically this does not lead to coherent forecasts — the property that forecasts add up appropriately across the hierarchy. State-of-the-art hierarchical forecasting methods usually reconcile these independently generated forecasts to satisfy the aggregation constraints. A fundamental limitation of prior research is that it has looked only at the problem of forecasting the mean of each time series.</description>

Course blurb Forecasting involves making predictions about the future.

      <guid>https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/nnetar-prediction-intervals/</guid>
      <description>The nnetar function in the forecast package for R fits a neural network model to a time series with lagged values of the time series as inputs (and possibly some other exogenous inputs). So it is a nonlinear autogressive model, and it is not possible to analytically derive prediction intervals. Therefore we use simulation.
Suppose we fit a NNETAR model to the famous Canadian lynx data:

      <description>Recently I was privileged to sit on the committee that selects the winner of the Karl Pearson Prize. KP was, of course, an early mathematical statistician, famous for many commonly-used statistical methods and tools including histograms, the correlation coefficient, the method of moments, p-values, the chi-squared test and principal components analysis. He is also infamous for his highly racist views, support for eugenics, anti-semitism and for refusing a knighthood.
All that aside, the job of the committee was to select an English-language article or book published in the last 30 years that has made a stand-alone research contribution, and which has had major influence on one or more of statistical theory, statistical methodology, statistical practice and application.</description>

      <title>Forecasting with temporal hierarchies</title>

      <guid>https://robjhyndman.com/publications/temporal-hierarchies/</guid>
      <description>This paper introduces the concept of Temporal Hierarchies for time series forecasting. A temporal hierarchy can be constructed for any time series by means of non-overlapping temporal aggregation. Predictions constructed at all aggregation levels are combined with the proposed framework to result in temporally reconciled, accurate and robust forecasts. The implied combination mitigates modelling uncertainty, while the reconciled nature of the forecasts results in a unified prediction that supports aligned decisions at different planning horizons: from short-term operational up to long-term strategic planning.</description>

      <description>I regularly get asked why I don&amp;rsquo;t consider monthly seasonality in my models for daily or sub-daily time series. For example, this recent comment on my post on seasonal periods, or this comment on my post on daily data. The fact is, I&amp;rsquo;ve never seen a time series with monthly seasonality, although that does not mean it does not exist.

      <title>Converting to blogdown</title>

      <description>This website has gone through several major updates over the years. It began in 1993 as some handcrafted html files, transitioned to Joomla and later to Wordpress. Then it slowly grew into a collection of ten connected Wordpress installations that became increasingly difficult to maintain, and rather slow.
So I&amp;rsquo;ve now converted the entire site to Blogdown/Hugo. Nearly 700 pages of wordpress content have been translated to markdown. I decided to drop a few parts of the site, notably the pages for my 1998 forecasting textbook.</description>

      <title>Grouped functional time series forecasting: an application to age-specific mortality rates</title>
      <link>https://robjhyndman.com/publications/grouped-functional-time-series-forecasting-an-application-to-age-specific-mortality-rates/</link>

      <description>Age-specific mortality rates are often disaggregated by different attributes, such as sex, state and ethnicity. Forecasting age-specific mortality rates at the national and sub-national levels plays an important role in developing social policy. However, independent forecasts of age-specific mortality rates at the sub-national levels may not add up to the forecasts at the national level. To address this issue, we consider the problem of reconciling age-specific mortality rate forecasts from the viewpoint of grouped univariate time series forecasting methods (Hyndman et al, 2011), and extend these methods to functional time series forecasting, where age is considered as a continuum.</description>

      <title>A note on upper bounds for forecast-value-added relative to naïve forecasts</title>

      <description>In forecast value added analysis, the accuracy of relatively sophisticated forecasting methods is compared to that of naïve 1 forecasts to see whether the extra costs and effort of implementing them are justified. In this note, we derive a ratio that indicates the upper bound of a forecasting method’s accuracy relative to naïve 1 forecasts when the mean squared error is used to measure one-period-ahead accuracy. The ratio is applicable when a series is stationary or when its first differences are stationary.</description>

      <description>In what is now a roughly annual event, the forecast package has been updated on CRAN with a new version, this time 8.0.
A few of the more important new features are described below.
Check residuals A common task when building forecasting models is to check that the residuals satisfy some assumptions (that they are uncorrelated, normally distributed, etc.). The new function checkresiduals makes this very easy: it produces a time plot, an ACF, a histogram with super-imposed normal curve, and does a Ljung-Box test on the residuals with appropriate number of lags and degrees of freedom.</description>

      <description>The International Symposium on Forecasting is a little unusual for an academic conference in that it has always had a strong presence of forecasters working in business and industry as well as academic forecasters, mostly at universities. We value the combination and interaction as it helps the academics understand the sorts of problems facing forecasters in practice, and it helps practitioners stay abreast of new methods and developments coming out of forecasting research.</description>

      <description>Background: Childhood asthma is a significant public health problem and severe exacerbation can result in diminished quality of life and hospitalisation.
Objective: To examine the contribution of outdoor fungi to childhood and adolescent asthma hospitalisations
Methods: The Melbourne Air Pollen Children and Adolescent (MAPCAH) study is a case-crossover study of 644 children and adolescents (aged 2-17 years) hospitalised for asthma between September 2009 and December 2011. MAPCAH collected individual data on human rhinovirus (HRV) infection and fungal sensitisation; and daily counts of ambient concentrations of fungal spores, pollen and air pollutants.</description>

 You use an illustration of a seasonal arima model:
ARIMA(1,1,1)(1,1,1)4
I would like to simulate data from this process then fit a model… but I am unable to find any information as to how this can be conducted… if I set phi1, Phi1, theta1, and Theta1 it would be reassuring that for large n the parameters returned by Arima(foo,order=c(1,1,1),seasonal=c(1,1,1)) are in agreement…

      <description>This paper presents a meta-algorithm for approximating the Pareto optimal set of costly black-box multiobjective optimization problems given a limited number of objective function evaluations. The key idea is to switch among different algorithms during the optimization search based on the predicted performance of each algorithm at the time. Algorithm performance is modeled using a machine learning technique based on the available information. The predicted best algorithm is then selected to run for a limited number of evaluations.</description>

      <description>It is common practice to evaluate the strength of forecasting methods using collections of well-studied time series datasets, such as the M3 data. But how diverse are these time series, how challenging, and do they enable us to study the unique strengths and weaknesses of different forecasting methods? In this paper we propose a visualisation method for a collection of time series that enables a time series to be represented as a point in a 2-dimensional instance space.</description>

      <title>Exploring the influence of short-term temperature patterns on temperature-related mortality: a case-study of Melbourne, Australia</title>

      <description>Background Several studies have identified the association between ambient temperature and mortality; however, several features of temperature behavior and their impacts on health remain unresolved.
We obtain daily counts of nonaccidental all-cause mortality data in the elderly (65 + years) and corresponding meteorological data for Melbourne, Australia during 1999 to 2006. We then characterize the temporal behavior of ambient temperature development by quantifying the rates of temperature change during periods designated by pre-specified windows ranging from 1 to 30 days.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve added a couple of new functions to the forecast package for R which implement two types of cross-validation for time series.K-fold cross-validation for autoregression The first is regular k-fold cross-validation for autoregressive models. Although cross-validation is sometimes not valid for time series models, it does work for autoregressions, which includes many machine learning approaches to time series. The theoretical background is provided in Bergmeir, Hyndman and Koo (2015). So cross-validation can be applied to any model where the predictors are lagged values of the response variable.</description>

      <guid>https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/qa-predictive-analytics/</guid>
      <description>A major news outlet interviewed me on predictive analytics. Here were my responses. Data mining is not just for tech companies, in fact it can be especially useful for industries which are not typically thought of to be &amp;lsquo;innovative&amp;rsquo; such as agriculture. What are some of the main industries that you think benefit from predictive analysis?
 Any industry that collects data can use data mining and statistical modelling.
Agriculture is becoming a heavy user of data science methods, with data being collected on every aspect of crop or livestock health and development.</description>

      <description>Someone sent me some questions by email, and I decided to answer some of them here. How important is it that I know and understand the underlying mathematical framework to forecasting methods? I understand conceptually how most of them work, but I feel as if I may benefit from truly understanding the math.
 The main benefit of understanding the mathematics behind different forecasting models is to be able to adapt the models when they don&amp;rsquo;t work well for your data.</description>

      <description>After the great success of the previous two energy forecasting competitions we have run (GEFCom2012 and GEFCom2014), we are holding another one, this time focused on hierarchical probabilistic load forecasting. Check out all the details over on Tao Hong&amp;rsquo;s blog.
The previous GEFComs have led to some major advances in forecasting methodology, available via IJF papers by the winning teams. I expect similar developments to arise out of this competition. Winners get to present their work in Cairns, Australia at ISEA2017.</description>

Abstract
Time series can often be naturally disaggregated in a hierarchical or grouped structure. For example, a manufacturing company can disaggregate total demand for their products by country of sale, retail outlet, product type, package size, and so on. As a result, there can be millions of individual time series to forecast at the most disaggregated level, plus additional series to forecast at higher levels of aggregation.</description>

      <guid>https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/forecast-intervals-for-aggregates/</guid>
      <description>A common problem is to forecast the aggregate of several time periods of data, using a model fitted to the disaggregated data. For example, you may have monthly data but wish to forecast the total for the next year. Or you may have weekly data, and want to forecast the total for the next four weeks.
If the point forecasts are means, then adding them up will give a good estimate of the total.</description>

      <title>R package forecast v7.2 now on CRAN</title>

      <guid>https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/forecast-v7-2/</guid>
      <description>I’ve pushed a minor update to the forecast package to CRAN. Some highlights are listed here.
Plotting time series with ggplot2 You can now facet a time series plot like this:
library(forecast) library(ggplot2) lungDeaths &amp;lt;- cbind(mdeaths, fdeaths) autoplot(lungDeaths, facets=TRUE) So autoplot.mts now behaves similarly to plot.mts
 Multi-step fitted values The fitted function has a new argument h to allow computation of in-sample fitted values of more than one-step-ahead. In time series, fitted values are defined as the one-step-forecasts of the data used in training a model.</description>

      <title>R packages for forecast combinations</title>

      <description>It has been well-known since at least 1969, when Bates and Granger wrote their famous paper on “The Combination of Forecasts”, that combining forecasts often leads to better forecast accuracy.
So it is helpful to have a couple of new R packages which do just that: opera and forecastHybrid.
opera Opera stands for “Online Prediction by ExpeRt Aggregation”. It was written by Pierre Gaillard and Yannig Goude, and Pierre provides a nice introduction in the vignette.</description>

      <description>This is only directly relevant to my Monash students and colleagues, but the same idea might be useful for adapting to other institutions.
Some recent changes in the rmarkdown and bookdown packages mean that it is now possible to produce working papers in exactly the same format as we previously used with LaTeX.Just install the MonashEBSTemplates package from github. You also need a recent version of LaTeX.
Then from within RStudio, create a new document by selecting &amp;ldquo;Rmarkdown&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;From Template&amp;rdquo;, and select &amp;ldquo;Monash EBS Working Paper&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>I have a new R package available to do temporal hierarchical forecasting, based on my paper with George Athanasopoulos, Nikolaos Kourentzes and Fotios Petropoulos. (Guess the odd guy out there!)
It is called “thief” - an acronym for Temporal HIErarchical Forecasting. The idea is to take a seasonal time series, and compute all possible temporal aggregations that result in an integer number of observations per year. For example, a quarterly time series is aggregated to biannual and annual; while a monthly time series is aggregated to 2-monthly, quarterly, 4-monthly, biannual and annual.</description>

      <description>International Symposium on Forecasting. Santander, Spain
It is common practice to evaluate the strength of forecasting methods using collections of well-studied time series datasets, such as the M3 data. But how diverse are these time series, how challenging, and do they enable us to study the unique strengths and weaknesses of different forecasting methods? In this paper we propose a visualisation method for a collection of time series that enables a time series to be represented as a point in a 2-dimensional feature space.</description>

      <description>Exponential smoothing is one of the most popular forecasting methods. We present a method for bootstrap aggregation (bagging) of exponential smoothing methods. The bagging uses a Box-Cox transformation followed by an STL decomposition to separate the time series into trend, seasonal part, and remainder. The remainder is then bootstrapped using a moving block bootstrap, and a new series is assembled using this bootstrapped remainder. On the bootstrapped series, an ensemble of exponential smoothing models is estimated.</description>

      <description>Almost exactly 20 years ago I wrote a paper with Yanan Fan on how sample quantiles are computed in statistical software. It was cited 43 times in the first 10 years, and 457 times in the next 10 years, making it my third paper to receive 500+ citations.
So what happened in 2006 to suddenly increase the citations? I think it was a combination of things: I wrote a new quantile() function (with Ivan Frohne) which made it into R core v2.</description>

      <description>This final collection of messages were from people who had already left the Christadelphian community, in some cases many years before me. I know very few of these people, but I appreciated their thoughtfulness in writing to me.
Message 31  I bet you have been getting the emails lately, huh? Some pulling this way, some pulling that way?
I can tell from the comments on the blog that there is a contest going on for the control of your thoughts and mind.</description>

      <description>Several people contacted me to say they were going through a similar process of deconversion. I think it was comforting for them (and for me) to know that the journey need not be a lonely one.
Message 26  I have similar questions, but it is hard for me to break away. I think it would be liberating but not sure I can bear the abject grief of my parents.</description>

      <description>A few of my correspondents wondered about my future. What would I do now I was no longer writing books and giving talks about the Bible? Would I start an atheist crusade with the same energy and enthusiasm I once gave to my preaching? Others wrote to me a few months after I had resigned, asking how I was getting on.
Message 23  I know that you feel as though you have had an epiphany and that you can finally see the ‘truth’ clearly, but from my very simple perspective, it looks more like you have been blinded as a result of your intelligence … that you have had your nose in the books so long that you have forgotten to look up and see the evidence of God all around you.</description>

      <description>A few parcels sent to me contained books and DVDs that were presumably supposed to convince me of my errors. I appreciate the care demonstrated by these gifts, but they do assume that I am misinformed and ignorant about what I believe.
I find it rather insulting to be told that I gave up on a lifetime of faith and religious activity without really thinking through the issues, and without reading widely.</description>

      <description>A lot of people have assumed that something awful must have happened to me, or that all the criticism directed at me has had some cumulative effect that has hurt my faith. It is not like that. I just don’t believe it, and I did not want to spend the rest of my life pretending otherwise.
Message 17 I know you have taken a hammering for having opinions different to some of the more traditional ones and I have to say some of them I share … but having them shouldn’t have made you a target for people’s fear.</description>

      <description>Understandably, a lot of my religious friends have said they are praying for me. I would have done the same when I was a believer. It was my instinctive response to any problem, and even after I came to the view that God was probably imaginary, I would still find myself occasionally wanting to pray when faced with difficulties. It is comforting to think that someone else might deal with the problems.</description>

      <description>In contrast to the letters in the previous chapter, most of the messages I received expressed sadness, love and friendship, for which I am deeply grateful.
I have very few comments on these. What can I say? I feel sad too. I have stayed in touch with most of these writers, and they remain dear friends even though we no longer have a shared faith.
Message 4 Just read your latest blog post … firstly wanted to say that I love and respect you and always will regardless of what you call yourself now But secondly you made me cry today … and for that you need a clip over the ears!</description>

      <description>I have received several hundred emails, letters and other messages as a result of my deconversion and resignation. Many of them were from friends, some from people who had read my books or heard me speak, and some were from people who only knew me as a professor of statistics but who were moved to send me their thoughts.
In this last section, I have included a selection of these messages along with some retrospective reflections.</description>

      <description>Christians often claim that their beliefs underpin their morality, and those who do not believe in God or the Bible must therefore lack a moral compass. They assume that values and morals are a consequence of holding the true doctrines. Well I have not become an axe-murderer since becoming an unbeliever, I have not suddenly become unfaithful to my wife, nor have I begun torturing kittens, I have not even started swearing.</description>

      <description>If the miracles of Jesus happened as reported, then they would provide evidence for him having supernatural power. If he really walked across the Sea of Galilee, provided food for thousands of people from five loaves and two fish, and raised Lazarus from the dead, then of course he is supernatural. If all those things are true, then his claims to be the Son of God would need to be taken seriously.</description>

      <description>The Way of Life book (pp.9–10) gives two examples of laws from Leviticus and Deuteronomy that supposedly demonstrate an understanding of science that was not possible for the Israelites to have developed.
Food prohibitions The first example is that the Law of Moses prohibited eating seafood (Leviticus 11:4–8,10–12) which we now know can cause intestinal problems and food poisoning without careful preparation and refrigeration.
However, it was not necessary to understand the science for the Israelites to have noticed that people who ate seafood often became ill.</description>

      <description>The contradictions game Three times I have debated skeptics of the Bible, and each time they raised Bible contradictions. I knew they would and I was prepared. I am rather good at reconciling contradictions. Give me a long list of apparent contradictions, and I can usually think of explanations. The difficulty is that the explanations are often contrived, and can seem like a desperate attempt to explain away the problem.</description>

      <description>I have given nearly 50 talks on biblical archaeology. One was entitled “Bible skeletons and fingerprints” in which I described some recent archaeological finds that supported and illuminated the biblical record. I showed photographs of the ossuary of Caiaphas from the first century AD, containing a skeleton of a 60 year old man — probably Caiaphas the high priest mentioned in the gospels. I covered the tiny clay seals that were found in Jerusalem from around 586BC.</description>

      <description>Sunday School nonsense In my early teens, I was taught in Sunday School that scientists had got it wrong — that the universe was actually a few thousand years old, not the billions of years claimed by the “evolutionists”. I found that confusing. I was aware that the light from the nearest galaxy to our own took at least a few tens of thousands of years to get here, and the light from many other galaxies took millions of years to arrive.</description>

      <description>The resurrection of Jesus is often cited as evidence of the Bible’s inspiration, or at least of God’s existence. There is an obvious problem here — all we know about the resurrection of Jesus comes from the Bible, so it cannot be used as evidence in support of itself. But leaving that difficulty aside, let’s review what the Bible actually says about it.
Harmonizing the accounts The resurrection accounts are notoriously difficult to harmonize.</description>

      <description>Forecasting is my area of expertise. I am Editor-in-Chief of the International Journal of Forecasting and I have written several textbooks on statistical forecasting. I spend many hours every week thinking about the probabilities associated with future events. So prophecy, which is closely related to forecasting, has always been of particular interest to me.
When I was a believer, my favourite fulfilled prophecies were
 the return of Israel to their land; Daniel’s prophecies of four empires; the destruction of Tyre; and the crucifixion of Jesus.</description>

      <description>It is natural for believers to thank God when they survive a natural disaster, or even when they avoid the effects of man-made tragedies. When the great tsunami of Boxing Day 2004 wiped out huge areas of Thailand, Indonesia, India and Sri Lanka, many survivors thanked God for protecting them. Others wondered what God was doing while 230,000 people died.
When the Australian Black Saturday bushfires in February 2009 killed 173 people, many survivors thanked God for protecting them.</description>

      <description>One of the first things I have been asked by people who find out that I no longer believe is “What about answered prayers?”.
Prayer is not falsifiable when you already believe Prayer is not falsifiable if you begin by assuming that God exists and is listening. If someone prays that X occurs and it does, then they say that the prayer has been answered. If X does not occur, then they say the answer was no, it wasn’t God’s will.</description>

      <description>I tried hard to have an active and regular prayer time every morning for many, many years. I would rise early and spend time jotting some thoughts in my prayer journal. Then I would offer a prayer based on what I had written. For a few months in 2002, when we lived in Canberra, I would walk to the top of a nearby mountain each morning, and surrounded by grazing kangaroos I would say my prayers as the sun rose over Black Mountain.</description>

      <description>The beautiful movie Life of Pi is a story about a boy (Pi) raised in India where his father owns a small zoo. He is deeply religious and simultaneously embraces Hinduism, Christianity and Islam. At one level, the book is about Pi’s deep faith in the face of his father’s atheist disapproval. When the family and zoo emigrate for Canada, the ship founders in a storm, and Pi finds himself on a lifeboat with a hyena, a chimpanzee, a zebra and a Bengal tiger for company.</description>

      <description>This is the blog post in which I announced my loss of faith and my resignation from the Christadelphian community — 29 July 2013
This week I resigned from the Christadelphian faith after nearly 30 years as a member, and having attended Christadelphian activities almost every week of my life.
I resigned because I no longer believe. I don’t believe the Bible is inspired by God. I am not even sure there is a God.</description>

After some correspondence, Josh read my blog, and responded with the following email (slightly edited):</description>

      <description>I was a Christadelphian1 for nearly 30 years, from age 16 until I resigned in July 2013 when I no longer thought that there was sufficient evidence to warrant belief in the Bible or Christianity. This book explains why I changed.
Many of my Christadelphian friends have asked why I no longer believe, and I want to give them the answer they deserve. After many years of speaking at Christadelphian meetings in Australia and in several other countries, there are a lot of people who have heard me talk about my faith, and will have wondered what has happened.</description>

      <description>I often see figures with two sets of prediction intervals plotted on the same graph using different line types to distinguish them. The results are almost always unreadable. A better way to do this is to use semi-transparent shaded regions. Here is an example showing two sets of forecasts for the Nile River flow.
library(forecast) f1 = forecast(auto.arima(Nile, lambda=0), h=20, level=95) f2 = forecast(ets(Nile), h=20, level=95) plot(f1, shadecol=rgb(0,0,1,.4), flwd=1, main=&amp;quot;Forecasts of Nile River flow&amp;quot;, xlab=&amp;quot;Year&amp;quot;, ylab=&amp;quot;Billions of cubic metres&amp;quot;) polygon(c(time(f2$mean),rev(time(f2$mean))), c(f2$lower,rev(f2$upper)), col=rgb(1,0,0,.</description>

 I wanted to ask you about your R forecast package, in particular the Arima() function. We are using this function to fit an ARIMAX model and produce model estimates and standard errors, which in turn can be used to get p-values and later model forecasts. To double check our work, we are also fitting the same model in SAS using PROC ARIMA and comparing model coefficients and output.</description>

      <title>On sampling methods for costly multi-objective black-box optimization</title>

      <description>We investigate the impact of different sampling techniques on the performance of multi-objective optimization methods applied to costly black-box optimization problems. Such problems are often solved using an algorithm in which a surrogate model approximates the true objective function and provides predicted objective values at a lower cost. As the surrogate model is based on evaluations of a small number of points, the quality of the initial sample can have a great effect on the overall effectiveness of the optimization.</description>

      <description>Someone sent me this email today:
 One of my colleagues said that you once said/wrote that you had encountered very few real outliers in your work, and that normally the &amp;ldquo;outlier-looking&amp;rdquo; data points were proper data points that should not have been treated as outliers. Have you discussed this in writing? If so, I would love to read it.
 I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ve ever said or written anything quite like that, and I see lots of outliers in real data.</description>

      <description>The GEFCom competitions have been a great success in generating good research on forecasting methods for electricity demand, and in enabling a comprehensive comparative evaluation of various methods. But they have only considered price forecasting in a simplified setting. So I&amp;rsquo;m happy to see this challenge is being taken up as part of the European Energy Market Conference for 2016, to be held from 6-9 June at the University of Porto in Portugal.</description>

      <title>Forecasting uncertainty in electricity smart meter data by boosting additive quantile regression</title>
      <link>https://robjhyndman.com/publications/smart-meter-quantiles/</link>

      <description>Smart electricity meters are currently deployed in millions of households to collect detailed individual electricity consumption data. Compared to traditional electricity data based on aggregated consumption, smart meter data are much more volatile and less predictable. There is a need within the energy industry for probabilistic forecasts of household electricity consumption to quantify the uncertainty of future electricity demand, in order to undertake appropriate planning of generation and distribution. We propose a probabilistic forecasting method where a different quantile regression model is estimated for each quantile of the future distribution.</description>

      <title>Fast computation of reconciled forecasts for hierarchical and grouped time series</title>
      <link>https://robjhyndman.com/publications/hgts/</link>

      <guid>https://robjhyndman.com/publications/hgts/</guid>
      <description>We show that the least squares approach to reconciling hierarchical time series forecasts can be extended to much more general collections of time series with aggregation constraints. The constraints arise due to the need for forecasts of collections of time series to add up in the same way as the observed time series. We also show that the computations involved can be handled efficiently by exploiting the structure of the associated design matrix, or by using sparse matrix routines.</description>

      <guid>https://robjhyndman.com/publications/bayesian-rank-selection-in-multivariate-regression/</guid>
      <description>Estimating the rank of the coefficient matrix is a major challenge in multivariate regression, including vector autoregression (VAR). In this paper, we develop a novel fully Bayesian approach that allows for rank estimation. The key to our approach is reparameterizing the coefficient matrix using its singular value decomposition and conducting Bayesian inference on the decomposed parameters. By implementing a stochastic search variable selection on the singular values of the coefficient matrix, the ultimate selected rank can be identified as the number of nonzero singular values.</description>

      <description>Today I attended the funeral of Peter Hall, one of the finest mathematical statisticians ever to walk the earth and easily the best from Australia. One of the most remarkable things about Peter was his astonishing productivity, with over 600 papers. As I sat in the audience I realised that many of the people there were probably coauthors of papers with Peter, and I wondered how many statisticians in the world would have been his coauthors or second-degree co-authors.</description>

      <description>The energy industry has been going through a significant modernization process over the last decade. Its infrastructure is being upgraded rapidly. The supply, demand and prices are becoming more volatile and less predictable than ever before. Even its business model is being challenged fundamentally. In this competitive and dynamic environment, many decision-making processes rely on probabilistic forecasts to quantify the uncertain future. Although most of the papers in the energy forecasting literature focus on point or single-valued forecasts, the research interest in probabilistic energy forecasting research has taken off rapidly in recent years.</description>

      <description>Many countries have implemented social programs providing long-term financial or in-kind entitlements. These programs often focus on specific age-groups and consequently their expenditure streams are subject to demographic change. Given the strains already existing on public budgets, long-term forecasts are an increasingly important instrument to monitor the budgetary consequences of social programs. The expected development of the labour force is a key input to these forecasts. We suggest combining a functional data approach to age-profiles of labour market participation rates with information on education, marital status and other exogenous variables to improve long-term forecasts of labour supply.</description>

No statistician will need reminding of Peter&amp;rsquo;s extensive contributions to the field. He had over 500 published papers, and had won every major award available, many of them listed on his Wikipedia page.I spent a few months visiting Peter at ANU in 2002, and we wrote a couple of papers together (here and here).</description>

Other professions seem a bit more straight forward, in that accountants for example simply look for Internships and ways into companies from there. From my understanding, the nature of careers in data science seem to be on a project-to-project basis. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how to get my foot stuck in the door.</description>

      <description>RStudio has been a life-changer for the way I work, and for how I teach data analysis. I still have a couple of minor frustrations with it, but they are slowly disappearing as RStudio adds features.
I use dual monitors and I like to code on one monitor and have the console and plots on the other monitor. Otherwise I see too little context, and long lines get wrapped making the code harder to read.</description>

Note the downloads figure: 264K/month. I know the package is popular, but that seems crazy.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been having discussions with colleagues and university administration about the best way for universities to manage home-grown software.
The traditional business model for software is that we build software and sell it to everyone willing to pay. Very often, that leads to a software company spin-off that has little or nothing to do with the university that nurtured the development. Think MATLAB, S-Plus, Minitab, SAS and SPSS, all of which grew out of universities or research institutions.</description>

      <description>I prepared the following notes for a consulting client, and I thought they might be of interest to some other people too.
Let \(y_t\) denote the value of the time series at time \(t\), and suppose we wish to fit a trend with correlated errors of the form \[ y_t = f(t) + n_t, \] where \(f(t)\) represents the possibly nonlinear trend and \(n_t\) is an autocorrelated error process.
For example, if \(f(t) = \beta_0+\beta_1 t\) is a linear function, then we can simply set \(x_{1,t}=t\) and define \[ y_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_{1,t} + n_t.</description>

Optimal forecast reconciliation for big time series data Time series can often be naturally disaggregated in a hierarchical or grouped structure. For example, a manufacturing company can disaggregate total demand for their products by country of sale, retail outlet, product type, package size, and so on. As a result, there can be millions of individual time series to forecast at the most disaggregated level, plus additional series to forecast at higher levels of aggregation.</description>

      <description>This is a very different book from my usual areas of forecasting and statistics. It is a personal memoir describing my journey of deconversion from Christianity.
Until a few years ago, I was regularly speaking at church conferences internationally, and my books are still used in Bible classes and Sunday Schools around the world. I even helped establish an innovative new church, which became a model for similar churches in other countries.</description>

      <description>I get asked to review journal papers almost every day, and I have to say no to almost all of them. I know it is hard to find reviewers, but many of these requests indicate very lazy editors. So to all the editors out there looking for reviewers, here is some advice.
 Never ask someone who is an editor for another journal. I am handling about 500 submissions per year for the International Journal of Forecasting, and about 10 per year for the Journal of Statistical Software.</description>

      <description>I’ve always struggled with using plotmath via the expression function in R for adding mathematical notation to axes or legends. For some reason, the most obvious way to write something never seems to work for me and I end up using trial and error in a loop with far too many iterations.
So I am very happy to see the new latex2exp package available which translates LaTeX expressions into a form suitable for R graphs.</description>

      <description>Current methods for using herbarium data as time series, for example to estimate the length of the invasion lag phase, often make assumptions that are both statistically and logically inappropriate. We present an alternative statistical approach, estimating the lag phase based on annual rather than cumulative data, a generalized linear model incorporating a log link for overall collection effort, and piecewise linear splines. We demonstrate the method on two species representing good and poor data quality, then apply it to two data sets comprising 448 species/region combinations.</description>

      <description>This week, I am teaching my Business Analytics class about the bias-variance trade-off. For some reason, the proof is not contained in either ESL or ISL, even though it is quite simple. I also discovered that the proof currently provided on Wikipedia makes little sense in places.
So I wrote my own for the class. It is longer than necessary to ensure there are no jumps that might confuse students.</description>

It is becoming increasingly common for organizations to collect very large amounts of data over time. Data visualization is essential for exploring and understanding structures and patterns, and to identify unusual observations. However, the sheer quantity of data available challenges current time series visualisation methods.
For example, Yahoo has banks of mail servers that are monitored over time. Many measurements on server performance are collected every hour for each of thousands of servers.</description>

      <description>Many people ask me to let them know when I write a new research paper. I can&amp;rsquo;t do that as there are too many people involved, and it is not scalable.
The solution is simple. Take your pick from the following options. Each is automatic and will let you know whenever I produce a new paper.

Why is it that we can accurately forecast a solar eclipse in 1000 years time, but we have no idea whether Yahoo&amp;rsquo;s stock price will rise or fall tomorrow? Or why can we forecast electricity consumption next week with remarkable precision, but we cannot forecast exchange rate fluctuations in the next hour?</description>

Many applications require a large number of time series to be forecast completely automatically. For example, manufacturing companies often require weekly forecasts of demand for thousands of products at dozens of locations in order to plan distribution and maintain suitable inventory stocks. In these circumstances, it is not feasible for time series models to be developed for each series by an experienced analyst. Instead, an automatic forecasting algorithm is required.</description>

I will describe and demonstrate a new open-source R package that implements the Monash Electricity Forecasting Model, a semi-parametric probabilistic approach to forecasting long-term electricity demand. The underlying model proposed in Hyndman and Fan (2010) is now widely used in practice, particularly in Australia. The model has undergone many improvements and developments since it was first proposed, and these have been incorporated in this R implementation.</description>

Electricity demand forecasting plays an important role in short-term load allocation and long-term planning for future generation facilities and transmission augmentation. It is a challenging problem because of the different uncertainties including underlying population growth, changing technology, economic conditions, prevailing weather conditions (and the timing of those conditions), as well as the general randomness inherent in individual usage. It is also subject to some known calendar effects due to the time of day, day of week, time of year, and public holidays.</description>

      <title>STR: A Seasonal-Trend Decomposition Procedure Based on Regression</title>

      <guid>https://robjhyndman.com/publications/str/</guid>
      <description>We propose new generic methods for decomposing seasonal data: STR (a Seasonal-Trend decomposition procedure based on Regression) and Robust STR. In some ways, STR is similar to Ridge Regression and Robust STR can be related to LASSO. Our new methods are much more general than any alternative time series decomposition methods. They allow for multiple seasonal and cyclic components, and multiple linear regressors with constant, flexible, seasonal and cyclic influence. Seasonal patterns (for both seasonal components and seasonal regressors) can be fractional and flexible over time; moreover they can be either strictly periodic or have a more complex topology.</description>

      <description>A large body of the forecasting literature so far has been focused on forecasting the conditional mean of future observations. However, there is an increasing need for generating the entire conditional distribution of future observations in order to effectively quantify the uncertainty in time series data. We present two different methods for probabilistic time series forecasting that allow the inclusion of a possibly large set of exogenous variables. One method is based on forecasting both the conditional mean and variance of the future distribution using a traditional regression approach.</description>

There are lots of reasons why you might select a particular software solution, and R isn&amp;rsquo;t for everyone. But anyone claiming superiority should at least provide some evidence rather than make unsubstantiated claims.The M3 forecasting competition was organized by Spyros Makridakis and Michèle Hibon.</description>

      <description>It is becoming increasingly common for organizations to collect very large amounts of data over time, and to need to detect unusual or anomalous time series. For example, Yahoo has banks of mail servers that are monitored over time. Many measurements on server performance are collected every hour for each of thousands of servers. We wish to identify servers that are behaving unusually.
We compute a vector of features on each time series, measuring characteristics of the series.</description>

      <description>The anomalous package provides some tools to detect unusual time series in a large collection of time series. This is joint work with Earo Wang (an honours student at Monash) and Nikolay Laptev (from Yahoo Labs). Yahoo is interested in detecting unusual patterns in server metrics. The package is based on this paper with Earo and Nikolay.
The basic idea is to measure a range of features of the time series (such as strength of seasonality, an index of spikiness, first order autocorrelation, etc.</description>

      <description>We suggest that a simple one-parameter family of cubic spline functions would serve quite adequately as models of the participation curve that is the key component of ITI calculations. This would remove the subjectivity associated with the use of two-parameter logistic functions, and would allow all states to use the same method for ITI calculations.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m speaking in the &amp;ldquo;Yahoo Labs Big Thinkers&amp;rdquo; series on Friday 26 June. I hope I can live up to the title!
My talk is on &amp;ldquo;Exploring the boundaries of predictability: what can we forecast, and when should we give up?&amp;rdquo; Essentially I will start with some of the ideas in this post, and then discuss the features of hard-to-forecast time series.
So if you&amp;rsquo;re in the San Francisco Bay area, please come along.</description>

      <description>One of my PhD students, Thilaksha Tharanganie, has been very successful in getting travel funding to attend conferences. She was the subject of a write-up in today&amp;rsquo;s Monash News.
We encourage students to attend conferences, and provide funding for them to attend one international conference and one local conference during their PhD candidature. Thilaksha was previously funded to attend last year&amp;rsquo;s COMPSTAT in Geneva, Switzerland and IMS conference in Sydney. Having exhausted local funding, she has now convinced several other organizations to support her conference habit.</description>

      <description>It is now exactly 12 months since the print version of my forecasting textbook with George Athanasopoulos was released on Amazon.com. Although the book is freely available online, it seems that a lot of people still like to buy print books.It&amp;rsquo;s nice to see that it has been getting some good reviews. It is rated 4.6 stars on Amazon.com with 6 out of 8 reviewers giving it 5 stars (the 3 reviewers on Amazon.</description>

      <description>One of the first things I tell my new research students is to use a reference management system to help them keep track of the papers they read, and to assist in creating bib files for their bibliography. Most of them use Mendeley, one or two use Zotero. Both do a good job and both are free.
I use neither. I did use Mendeley for several years, but it became slower and slower to sync as my reference collection grew.</description>

      <description>Yahoo Labs has just released an interesting new data set useful for research on detecting anomalies (or outliers) in time series data. There are many contexts in which anomaly detection is important. For Yahoo, the main use case is in detecting unusual traffic on Yahoo servers.The data set comprises real traffic to Yahoo services, along with some synthetic data. There are 367 time series in the data set, each of which contains between 741 and 1680 observations recorded at regular intervals.</description>

      <description>This question comes from a comment on another post:
 I&amp;rsquo;ve seen authors citing as many references as possible to try to please potential referees. Many of those references are low quality papers though. Any general guidance about a typical length for the reference section?
 It depends on the subject and style of the paper. I&amp;rsquo;ve written a paper with over 900 citations, but that was a review of time series forecasting over a 25 year period, and so it had to include a lot of references.</description>

That is, I write with light colored text on a dark background. I don&amp;rsquo;t know why this is not the default in more software as it makes a big difference after a few hours of writing.
Most of the time, I am writing using either Sublime Text, RStudio or TeXstudio.</description>

      <description>Every week I reject some papers submitted to the International Journal of Forecasting, without sending the papers off to associate editors or reviewers. Here are five of the most common reasons for rejection.1. Wrong Journal Submissions to the IJF should be about forecasting, obviously. But we often get papers on econometrics, or time series analysis, or something else that is not forecasting. Even if a paper has some implications for forecasting, if these are not discussed at all, the paper is not within scope for the journal.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m currently attending the one day workshop on this topic at QUT in Brisbane. This morning I spoke on &amp;ldquo;Visualizing and forecasting big time series data&amp;rdquo;. My slides are here.
OVERVIEW Big data is now endemic in business, industry, government, environmental management, medical science, social research and so on. One of the commensurate challenges is how to effectively model and analyse these data.
This workshop will bring together national and international experts in statistical modelling and analysis of big data, to share their experiences, approaches and opinions about future directions in this field.</description>

So anyone can easily subscribe to all of the same journals, or select a subset of them, to follow on feedly.There are about 90 journals on the list, mostly in statistics, but some from machine learning, operations research and econometrics. I excluded probability journals, and areas of application that are well outside my research interests (such as bioinformatics, psychology and pharmacology).</description>

Time series can often be naturally disaggregated in a hierarchical or grouped structure. For example, a manufacturing company can disaggregate total demand for their products by country of sale, retail outlet, product type, package size, and so on. As a result, there can be millions of individual time series to forecast at the most disaggregated level, plus additional series to forecast at higher levels of aggregation.</description>

The package is called &amp;ldquo;MEFM&amp;rdquo; and is available on github. We will probably also put in on CRAN eventually.</description>

      <description>I do not normally post job adverts, but this was very specifically targeted to &amp;ldquo;applied time series candidates&amp;rdquo; so I thought it might be of sufficient interest to readers of this blog.Here is an excerpt from an email I received from someone at Amazon:
 Amazon is aggressively recruiting in the data sciences, and we have found that applied economists compare quite favorably with the machine learning specialists and statisticians that are sometimes recruited for such roles.</description>

      <title>Prediction intervals too narrow</title>
      <link>https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/narrow-pi/</link>

      <description>Almost all prediction intervals from time series models are too narrow. This is a well-known phenomenon and arises because they do not account for all sources of uncertainty. In my 2002 IJF paper, we measured the size of the problem by computing the actual coverage percentage of the prediction intervals on hold-out samples. We found that for ETS models, nominal 95% intervals may only provide coverage between 71% and 87%. The difference is due to missing sources of uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Optimally reconciling forecasts in a hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://robjhyndman.com/publications/foresight-hts/</link>

      <description>This is an introduction to our approach to forecast reconciliation without using any matrices. The original research is available here:
 Hyndman, Ahmed, Athanasopoulos and Shang (CSDA, 2011) Athanasopoulos, Ahmed and Hyndman (IJF, 2009)  The software is available in the hts package for R with some notes on usage in the vignette. There is also a gentle introduction in our forecasting textbook.</description>

      <title>hts with regressors</title>

      <guid>https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/hts-with-regressors/</guid>
      <description>The hts package for R allows for forecasting hierarchical and grouped time series data. The idea is to generate forecasts for all series at all levels of aggregation without imposing the aggregation constraints, and then to reconcile the forecasts so they satisfy the aggregation constraints. (An introduction to reconciling hierarchical and grouped time series is available in this Foresight paper.)
The base forecasts can be generated using any method, with ETS models and ARIMA models provided as options in the forecast.</description>

      <title>Explaining the ABS unemployment fluctuations</title>

      <description>Although the Guardian claimed yesterday that I had explained “what went wrong” in the July and August unemployment figures, I made no attempt to do so as I had no information about the problems. Instead, I just explained a little about the purpose of seasonal adjustment.
However, today I learned a little more about the ABS unemployment data problems, including what may be the explanation for the fluctuations. This explanation was offered by Westpac’s chief economist, Bill Evans (see here for a video of him explaining the issue).</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s not every day that seasonal adjustment makes the front page of the newspapers, but it has today with the ABS saying that the recent seasonally adjusted unemployment data would be revised.
I was interviewed about the underlying concepts for the Guardian in this piece.

      <description>I keep telling students that there are lots of jobs in data science (including statistics), and they often tell me they can&amp;rsquo;t find them advertised. As usual, you do have to do some networking, and one of the best ways of doing it is via a Data Science Meetup. Many cities now have them including Melbourne, Sydney, London, etc. It is the perfect opportunity to meet with local employers, many of which are hiring due to the huge expansion in the use of data analysis in business (aka business analytics).</description>

      <description>The International Institute of Forecasters sponsors workshops every year, each of which focuses on a specific theme. The purpose of these workshops is to facilitate small, informal meetings where experts in a particular field of forecasting can discuss forecasting problems, research, and solutions. Over the years, our workshops have covered topics from Predicting Rare Events, ICT Forecasting, and, most recently, Singular Spectrum Analysis. Often these workshops are associated with a special issue of the International Journal of Forecasting.</description>

      <guid>https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/tbats-with-regressors/</guid>
      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve received a few emails about including regression variables (i.e., covariates) in TBATS models. As TBATS models are related to ETS models, tbats() is unlikely to ever include covariates as explained here. It won&amp;rsquo;t actually complain if you include an xreg argument, but it will ignore it.
When I want to include covariates in a time series model, I tend to use auto.arima() with covariates included via the xreg argument. If the time series has multiple seasonal periods, I use Fourier terms as additional covariates.</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago I had a Skype chat with Tim Harford, the &amp;ldquo;Undercover Economist&amp;rdquo; for Britain&amp;rsquo;s Financial Times. He was working on an article for the FT on forecasting, and wanted my perspective as an academic forecaster. I mostly talked about what makes some things more predictable than others, as discussed in this blog post. In the end, his article headed in a different direction, so I don&amp;rsquo;t get quoted, but it is still a good read!</description>

      <description>From today’s email:
 I have just finished reading a copy of ‘Forecasting:Principles and Practice’ and I have found the book really interesting. I have particularly enjoyed the case studies and focus on practical applications.
After finishing the book I have joined a forecasting competition to put what I’ve learnt to the test. I do have a couple of queries about the forecasting outputs required. The output required is a quantile forecast, is this the same as prediction intervals?</description>

      <description>Introduction Asthma can be exacerbated by exposure to various fungal spores and Human Rhinovirus [HRV], but current understanding of the importance of fungal exposure to child asthma hospitalisations is limited. Moreover the interaction between HRV and fungal spore exposure on admission has not been examined.
Aim To investigate the role of outdoor fungal spores in child asthma hospitalisations and if HRV modifies any such effect.
Methods We conducted a case-crossover study of 644 child asthma hospitalisations in Melbourne, Australia (2009–11).</description>

      <description>In this paper, we focus on expensive multiobjective optimization problems and propose a method to predict an approximation of the Pareto optimal set using classification of sampled decision vectors as dominated or nondominated. The performance of our method, called EPIC, is demonstrated on a set of benchmark problems used in the multiobjective optimization literature and compared with state-of-the-art methods, ParEGO and PAL. The initial results are promising and encourage further research in this direction.</description>

      <guid>https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/coherent-population-forecasting/</guid>
      <description>This is an example of how to use the demography package in R for stochastic population forecasting with coherent components. It is based on the papers by Hyndman and Booth (IJF 2008) and Hyndman, Booth and Yasmeen (Demography 2013). I will use Australian data from 1950 to 2009 and forecast the next 50 years.
In demography, &amp;ldquo;coherent&amp;rdquo; forecasts are where male and females (or other sub-groups) do not diverge over time.</description>

      <description>Rolling forecasts are commonly used to compare time series models. Here are a few of the ways they can be computed using R. I will use ARIMA models as a vehicle of illustration, but the code can easily be adapted to other univariate time series models.One-step forecasts without re-estimation The simplest approach is to estimate the model on a single set of training data, and then compute one-step forecasts on the remaining test data.</description>

      <description>Every year, the International Institute of Forecasters in conjunction with SAS offer some small grants to help promote research in forecasting. There are two $5000 grants per year for research on forecasting methodology and applications. This year, applications close on 30 September 2014. More details are given here.
Information about past SAS-IIF awards is given on the IIF website. It is interesting to see the range of topics covered. Here are the winning projects in the last two years:</description>

      <description>I am giving a two-part seminar at the Energy Forum, Valais/Wallis, Switzerland, on 17 June 2014. (English brochure)
Abstract: Electricity demand forecasting plays an important role in short-term load allocation and long-term planning for future generation facilities and transmission augmentation. It is a challenging problem because of the different uncertainties including underlying population growth, changing technology, economic conditions, prevailing weather conditions (and the timing of those conditions), as well as the general randomness inherent in individual usage.</description>

      <description>Last week my research group discussed Hal Varian&amp;rsquo;s interesting new paper on &amp;ldquo;Big data: new tricks for econometrics&amp;rdquo;, Journal of Economic Perspectives, 28(2): 3-28.
It&amp;rsquo;s a nice introduction to trees, bagging and forests, plus a very brief entree to the LASSO and the elastic net, and to slab and spike regression. Not enough to be able to use them, but ok if you&amp;rsquo;ve no idea what they are. It was more disappointing on boosting (completely ignoring the fact that boosting can be applied in a regression context as well as a classification context), and his comments on causality seemed curiously naive.</description>

      <title>Specifying complicated groups of time series in hts</title>

      <description>With the latest version of the hts package for R, it is now possible to specify rather complicated grouping structures relatively easily.
All aggregation structures can be represented as hierarchies or as cross-products of hierarchies. For example, a hierarchical time series may be based on geography: country, state, region, store. Often there is also a separate product hierarchy: product groups, product types, packet size. Forecasts of all the different types of aggregation are required; e.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m about to head off on a speaking tour to Europe (more on that in another post) and one of my hosts has asked for my powerpoint slides so they can print them. They have made two false assumptions: (1) that I use powerpoint; (2) that my slides are static so they can be printed.
Instead, I produced a cut-down version of my beamer slides, leaving out some of the animations and other features that will not print easily.</description>

      <title>Low-dimensional decomposition, smoothing and forecasting of sparse functional data</title>

      <description>We propose a new generic method ROPES (Regularized Optimization for Prediction and Estimation with Sparse data) for decomposing, smoothing and forecasting two-dimensional sparse data. In some ways, ROPES is similar to Ridge Regression, the LASSO, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Maximum-Margin Matrix Factorisation (MMMF). Using this new approach, we propose a practical method of forecasting mortality rates, as well as a new method for interpolating and extrapolating sparse longitudinal data. We also show how to calculate prediction intervals for the resulting estimates.</description>

      <guid>https://robjhyndman.com/publications/cfpc-iwfos/</guid>
      <description>We explore models for forecasting groups of functional time series data that exploit common features in the data. Our models involve fitting common (or partially common) functional principal component models and forecasting the coefficients using univariate time series methods. We illustrate our approach by forecasting age-specific mortality rates for males and females in Australia.

      <title>Structural breaks</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m tired of reading about tests for structural breaks and here&amp;rsquo;s why.
A structural break occurs when we see a sudden change in a time series or a relationship between two time series. Econometricians love papers on structural breaks, and apparently believe in them. Personally, I tend to take a different view of the world. I think a more realistic view is that most things change slowly over time, and only occasionally with sudden discontinuous change.</description>

      <description>Last week, my research group discussed Galit Shmueli&amp;rsquo;s paper &amp;ldquo;To explain or to predict?&amp;rdquo;, Statistical Science, 25(3), 289-310. (See her website for further materials.) This is a paper everyone doing statistics and econometrics should read as it helps to clarify a distinction that is often blurred. In the discussion, the following issues were covered amongst other things.
 The AIC is better suited to model selection for prediction as it is asymptotically equivalent to leave-one-out cross-validation in regression, or one-step-cross-validation in time series.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve received a few questions on the business analytics jobs advertised last week. I think it is best if I answer them here so other potential candidates can have the same information. I will add to this post if I receive more questions.1. What are your expectations in terms of outputs (KPIs)? Typically, a person at Level B (Lecturer) in our department would be producing at least one refereed article in a good scholarly journal per year.</description>

      <description>Today&amp;rsquo;s email question:
 I work within a government budget office and sometimes have to forecast fairly simple time series several quarters into the future. Auto.arima() works great and I often get something along the lines of: ARIMA(0,0,1)(1,1,0)[12] with drift as the lowest AICc.
However, my boss (who does not use R) takes issue with low-order AR and MA because &amp;ldquo;you&amp;rsquo;re essentially using forecasted data to make your forecast.&amp;rdquo; His models include AR(10) MA(12)s etc.</description>

This is part of a plan to strengthen our research and teaching in the data science/computational statistics area. We are hoping to make multiple appointments, at junior and senior levels. These are five-year appointments, but we hope that the positions will continue after that if we can secure suitable funding.What is business analytics? You can think of &amp;ldquo;business analytics&amp;rdquo; as the application of data analysis to business problems.</description>

      <description>There are several other blogs on forecasting that readers might be interested in. Here are seven worth following:
 No Hesitations by Francis Diebold (Professor of Economics, University of Pennsylvania). Diebold needs no introduction to forecasters. He primarily covers forecasting in economics and finance, but also xkcd cartoons, graphics, research issues, etc.
 Econometrics Beat by Dave Giles. Dave is a professor of economics at the University of Victoria (Canada), formerly from my own department at Monash University (Australia), and a native New Zealander.</description>

      <description>The MAPE (mean absolute percentage error) is a popular measure for forecast accuracy and is defined as $$ \text{MAPE} = 100\text{mean}(|y_t - \hat{y}_t|/|y_t|) $$ where $y_t$ denotes an observation and $\hat{y}_t$ denotes its forecast, and the mean is taken over $t$.
Armstrong (1985, p.348) was the first (to my knowledge) to point out the asymmetry of the MAPE saying that &amp;ldquo;it has a bias favoring estimates that are below the actual values&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Typing tables in LaTeX can get messy, but there are some good tools to simplify the process. One I discovered this week is tablesgenerator.com, a web-based tool for generating LaTeX tables. It also allows the table to saved in other formats including HTML and Markdown. The interface is simple, but it does most things. For complicated tables, some additional formatting may be necessary.
Similar functionality is available via plugins in Excel, OpenOffice and Libreoffice &amp;mdash; useful if the data for the table is already stored in a spreadsheet.</description>

      <description>When watching the TV news, or reading newspaper commentary, I am frequently amazed at the attempts people make to interpret random noise.
For example, the latest tiny fluctuation in the share price of a major company is attributed to the CEO being ill. When the exchange rate goes up, the TV finance commentator confidently announces that it is a reaction to Chinese building contracts. No one ever says &amp;ldquo;The unemployment rate has dropped by 0.</description>

The competition involved a hierarchical load forecasting problem for a US utility with 20 geographical zones. The available data consisted of the hourly loads for the 20 zones and hourly temperatures from 11 weather stations, for four and a half years. For each zone, the hourly electricity load for nine different weeks needed to be predicted without having the location of zones or stations.</description>

      <description>The leave-one-out cross-validation statistic is given by
 $$ \text{CV} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N e_{[i]}^2, $$  where ${e_{[i]} = y_{i} - \hat{y}_{[i]}} $, the observations are given by $y_{1},\dots,y_{N}$, and $\hat{y}_{[i]}$ is the predicted value obtained when the model is estimated with the $i\text{th}$ case deleted. This is also sometimes known as the PRESS (Prediction Residual Sum of Squares) statistic.
It turns out that for linear models, we do not actually have to estimate the model $N$ times, once for each omitted case.</description>

      <description>The IJF is introducing occasional review papers on areas of forecasting. We did a whole issue in 2006 reviewing 25 years of research since the International Institute of Forecasters was established. Since then, there has been a lot of new work in application areas such as call center forecasting and electricity price forecasting. In addition, there are areas we did not cover in 2006 including new product forecasting and forecasting in finance.</description>

      <description>Today&amp;rsquo;s email brought this one:
 I was wondering if I could get your opinion on a particular problem that I have run into during the reviewing process of an article.
Basically, I have an analysis where I am looking at a couple of time-series and I wanted to know if, over time there was an upward trend in the series. Inspection of the raw data suggests there is, but we want some statistical evidence for this.</description>

 I have a small problem. I have a time series called x :
 If I use the default values of auto.arima(x), the best model is an ARIMA(1,0,0)
 However, I tried the function ndiffs(x, test=&amp;ldquo;adf&amp;rdquo;) and ndiffs(x, test=&amp;ldquo;kpss&amp;rdquo;) as the KPSS test seems to be the default value, and the number of difference is 0 for the kpss test (consistent with the results of auto.</description>

      <description>This is a short piece I wrote for the next issue of the Oracle newsletter produced by the International Institute of Forecasters.Special section topics We continue to publish special sections on selected topics. Because of the change in the way regular papers are now handled, we do not publish whole special issues any more. Rather, each issue has regular papers at the front, and if there are any special sections they appear at the back.</description>

      <description>Users of my new online forecasting book have asked about having a facility for personal highlighting of selected sections, as students often do with print books. We have plans to make this a built-in part of the platform, but for now it is possible to do it using a simple browser extension. This approach allows any website to be highlighted, so is even more useful than if we only had the facility on OTexts.</description>

      <description>This is another situation where Fourier terms are useful for handling the seasonality. Not only is the seasonal period rather long, it is non-integer (averaging 365.25/7 = 52.18). So ARIMA and ETS models do not tend to give good results, even with a period of 52 as an approximation.
Regression with ARIMA errors The simplest approach is a regression with ARIMA errors. Here is an example using weekly data on US finished motor gasoline products supplied (in thousands of barrels per day) from February 1991 to May 2005.</description>

      <description>Following my post on fitting models to long time series, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d tackle the opposite problem, which is more common in business environments.
I often get asked how few data points can be used to fit a time series model. As with almost all sample size questions, there is no easy answer. It depends on the number of model parameters to be estimated and the amount of randomness in the data.</description>

      <description>I received this email today:
 I recall you made this very insightful remark somewhere that, fitting a standard arima model with too much data, ie. a very long time series, is a bad idea.
Can you elaborate why?
I can see the issue with noise, which compounds the ML estimation as the series gets too long. But is there anything else?
 I&amp;rsquo;m not sure where I made a comment about this, but it is true that ARIMA models don&amp;rsquo;t work well for very long time series.</description>

In addition, he provides Matlab code to compute a large number of characteristics. Anyone wanting to test time series algorithms on a large collection of data should take a look.</description>

      <title>The forecast mean after back-transformation</title>

      <description>Many functions in the forecast package for R will allow a Box-Cox transformation. The models are fitted to the transformed data and the forecasts and prediction intervals are back-transformed. This preserves the coverage of the prediction intervals, and the back-transformed point forecast can be considered the median of the forecast densities (assuming the forecast densities on the transformed scale are symmetric). For many purposes, this is acceptable, but occasionally the mean forecast is required.</description>

But he has another career as a member of the UK House of Lords (under the name Viscount Hanworth &amp;ndash; he is a hereditary peer).
It made me wonder how many other politicians have PhDs (or equivalent) in statistics, or at least in mathematics.</description>

      <description>It is common to want forecasts to be positive, or to require them to be within some specified range \([a,b]\). Both of these situations are relatively easy to handle using transformations.Positive forecasts To impose a positivity constraint, simply work on the log scale. With the forecast package in R, this can be handled by specifying the Box-Cox parameter \(\lambda=0\). For example, consider the real price of a dozen eggs (1900-1993; in cents):</description>

      <description>Sometimes it is useful to “backcast” a time series — that is, forecast in reverse time. Although there are no in-built R functions to do this, it is very easy to implement. Suppose x is our time series and we want to backcast for \(h\) periods. Here is some code that should work for most univariate time series. The example is non-seasonal, but the code will also work with seasonal data.</description>

      <description>Talk presented at the conference &amp;ldquo;New Trends on Intelligent Systems and Soft Computing 2014&amp;rdquo;, University of Granada, Spain. 13-14 February 2014.Abstract Many applications require a large number of time series to be forecast completely automatically. For example, manufacturing companies often require weekly forecasts of demand for thousands of products at dozens of locations in order to plan distribution and maintain suitable inventory stocks. In these circumstances, it is not feasible for time series models to be developed for each series by an experienced analyst.</description>

There are some minor syntax changes, but the biggest change is speed and scope. This version is many times faster than the previous version and can handle hundreds of thousands of time series without complaining. The speed-up is due to some new research I am doing with Alan Lee (University of Auckland).</description>

We are also ranked 13th in the world in forecasting.

These rankings are only a rough indication of quality, but it is nice to see the department being recognized.</description>

The model is a first order threshold autoregression:
 $$ y_t = \begin{cases} \alpha y_{t-1} + e_t &amp; \text{if $y_{t-1} \le r$}\\ \beta y_{t-1} + \gamma e_t &amp; \text{if $y_{t-1}r$} \end{cases} $$  where $e_t$ is a Gaussian white noise series with variance $\sigma^2$.</description>

      <description>Multi-step forecasts can be produced recursively by iterating a one-step model, or directly using a specific model for each horizon. Choosing between these two strategies is not an easy task since it involves a trade-off between bias and estimation variance over the forecast horizon. Using a nonlinear machine learning model makes the tradeoff even more difficult. To address this issue, we propose a new forecasting strategy which boosts traditional recursive linear forecasts with a direct strategy using a boosting autoregression procedure at each horizon.</description>

      <description>The Centre for Forecasting at Lancaster University is conducting some research on judgmental forecasting and model selection. They hope to compare the performance of judgmental model selection with statistical model selection, in order to learn how to best design forecasting support systems. They would like forecasting students, practitioners and researchers to participate, and are offering £50 Amazon Gift Cards as prizes. Here is a brief description from Fotios Petropoulos: We are inviting you to participate in a web-based judgmental forecasting exercise.</description>

      <description>Abstract: Since the introduction of Response Surface Methodology in the 1950s, there have been many developments with the aim of expanding the range of applications of the methodology. Various new design, modeling and optimization techniques have been introduced for coping with unknown input-output relationships, costly or time-consuming experimental studies and irregular experimental regions (e.g., non-cubic or non-spherical regions induced by constraints in the input variables). Such developments may involve many different research areas simultaneously (e.</description>

Here are the details (taken from Tao Hong&amp;rsquo;s blog).In today&amp;rsquo;s competitive and dynamic environment, more and more decision making processes in the energy industry are relying on probabilistic forecasts. The applications of probabilistic energy forecasts spread across planning and operations of the entire energy value chain. We are seeking papers from researchers working on the areas of probabilistic energy forecasting.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve had several emails recently asking how to forecast daily data in R. Unless the time series is very long, the easiest approach is to simply set the frequency attribute to 7.
y &amp;lt;- ts(x, frequency=7)  Then any of the usual time series forecasting methods should produce reasonable forecasts. For example
library(forecast) fit &amp;lt;- ets(y) fc &amp;lt;- forecast(fit) plot(fc)  When the time series is long enough to take in more than a year, then it may be necessary to allow for annual seasonality as well as weekly seasonality.</description>

Here are some thoughts and highlights of the conference, in no particular order. Håvard Rue spoke on Bayesian computing with INLA and the R-INLA package.</description>

      <description>Akaike&amp;rsquo;s Information Criterion (AIC) is a very useful model selection tool, but it is not as well understood as it should be. I frequently read papers, or hear talks, which demonstrate misunderstandings or misuse of this important tool. The following points should clarify some aspects of the AIC, and hopefully reduce its misuse. The AIC is a penalized likelihood, and so it requires the likelihood to be maximized before it can be calculated.</description>

      <description>This question was posed on crossvalidated.com:
 I have a monthly time series (for 2009-2012 non-stationary, with seasonality). I can use ARIMA (or ETS) to obtain point and interval forecasts for each month of 2013, but I am interested in forecasting the total for the whole year, including prediction intervals. Is there an easy way in R to obtain interval forecasts for the total for 2013?
 I&amp;rsquo;ve come across this problem before in my consulting work, although I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ve ever published my solution.</description>

      <description>Last Thursday (28 March 2013), George Box passed away at the age of 93. He was one of the great statisticians of the last 100 years, and leaves an astonishingly diverse legacy.
When I teach forecasting to my second year commerce students, we cover Box-Cox transformations, Box-Pierce and Ljung-Box tests, and Box-Jenkins modelling, and my students wonder if it is the same Box in all cases. It is. And we don&amp;rsquo;t even go near his work on response surface modelling, design of experiments, quality control or random number generation.</description>

      <description>Prediction intervals and confidence intervals are not the same thing. Unfortunately the terms are often confused, and I am often frequently correcting the error in students&amp;rsquo; papers and articles I am reviewing or editing.
A prediction interval is an interval associated with a random variable yet to be observed, with a specified probability of the random variable lying within the interval. For example, I might give an 80% interval for the forecast of GDP in 2014.</description>

      <description>When I want to insert figures generated in R into a LaTeX document, it looks better if I first remove the white space around the figure. Unfortunately, R does not make this easy as the graphs are generated to look good on a screen, not in a document.
There are two things that can be done to fix this problem.First, you can reduce the white space generated by R. I use the following function when saving figures in R.</description>

      <description>It is common to fit a model using training data, and then to evaluate its performance on a test data set. When the data are time series, it is useful to compute one-step forecasts on the test data. For some reason, this is much more commonly done by people trained in machine learning rather than statistics.
If you are using the forecast package in R, it is easily done with ETS and ARIMA models.</description>

      <description>There must be dozens of statistical consulting businesses and organizations in Australia, each specializing in different areas.
I do some consulting work myself, mostly in the forecasting area, but sometimes in other areas of applied statistics including expert witness work in court cases. Email me if you have a project you would like me to take on. However, I often refer potential clients to other statistical consulting groups, as I only have a limited amount of time I can spend on consulting projects.</description>

      <description>Keynote address. Young Statisticians Conference 2013.
Abstract: For 25 years I have been an intrepid statistical consultant, tackling the wild frontiers of real data, real problems and real time constraints. I have faced problems ranging from linguistics to river beds, from making paper plates to selling pies at the MCG, from tax office audits to surveys about the colour purple. University education helps prepare you to be a statistical consultant in the same way that Google maps helps prepare you to cross the Simpson Desert.</description>

      <title>Coherent mortality forecasting: the product-ratio method with functional time series models</title>
      <link>https://robjhyndman.com/publications/coherentfdm/</link>

      <guid>https://robjhyndman.com/publications/coherentfdm/</guid>
      <description>When independence is assumed, forecasts of mortality for subpopulations are almost always divergent in the long term. We propose a method for coherent forecasting of mortality rates for two or more subpopulations, based on functional principal components models of simple and interpretable functions of rates. The product-ratio functional forecasting method models and forecasts the geometric mean of subpopulation rates and the ratio of subpopulation rates to product rates. Coherence is imposed by constraining the forecast ratio function through stationary time series models.</description>

      <description>I sometimes get asked about forecasting many time series automatically. Here is a recent email, for example:
 I have looked but cannot find any info on generating forecasts on multiple data sets in sequence. I have been using analysis services for sql server to generate fitted time series but it is too much of a black box (or I don’t know enough to tweak/manage the inputs). In short, what package should I research that will allow me to load data, generate a forecast (presumably best fit), export the forecast then repeat for a few thousand items.</description>

      <description>A few days ago I released version 4.0 of the forecast package for R. There were quite a few changes and new features, so I thought it deserved a new version number. I keep a list of changes in the Changelog for the package, but I doubt that many people look at it. So for the record, here are the most important changes to the forecast package made since v3.0 was released.</description>

      <description>Updated: 21 November 2012
Make is a marvellous tool used by programmers to build software, but it can be used for much more than that. I use make whenever I have a large project involving R files and LaTeX files, which means I use it for almost all of the papers I write, and almost of the consulting reports I produce.If you are using a Mac or Linux, you will already have make installed.</description>

      <description>Young Victorian statisticians should be attending the YSC conference in Melbourne in February 2013. It promises to be a great event, and the speaker line-up looks first-class (apart from one dodgy keynote speaker).
If you think you can&amp;rsquo;t afford it, there is good news! The local SSA Branch is offering financial support to selected young statisticians. Applicants must be student members of the Victorian Branch (to join, see www.statsoc.org.au/join.htm). Successful applicants will be given free conference registration.</description>

      <description>Today I was writing a report which included 20 figures, with the names demandplot1.pdf, demandplot2.pdf, &amp;hellip;, demandplot20.pdf, and all with similar captions. Clearly a loop was required. After all, LaTeX is a programming language, so we should be able to take advantage of its capabilities.I found the forloop package which handled the problem perfectly. My first attempt looked like this:
\newcommand{\demandplot}[1]{\begin{figure}\centering \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./figs/demandplot#1.pdf} \caption{Hourly demand (GW) for zone #1.} \end{figure}} \newcounter{loop} \forloop{loop}{1}{\value{loop}&amp;lt;21}{\demandplot{\arabic{loop}}}  The magic happens in the last line providing a loop from 1 to 20, generating the commands \demandplot{1}, \demandplot{2}, &amp;hellip;, \demandplot{20}.</description>

      <description>The International Institute of Forecasters and SAS have an annual research grant scheme that has been offered for the past ten years. The amounts offered are small (a total of $10K per year, usually split between 2 or 3 projects), but it might be useful for young researchers wanting a bit of funding to help with their forecasting research. The deadline for 2012 has just been extended to 26 October, which is a sure sign that they don&amp;rsquo;t have enough applications yet.</description>

      <description>Forecasters are often met with skepticism. Almost every time I tell someone that I work in forecasting, they say something about forecasting the stock market, or forecasting the weather, usually suggesting that such forecasts are hopelessly inaccurate. In fact, forecasts of the weather are amazingly accurate given the complexity of the system, while anyone claiming to forecast the stock market deserves skepticism. So what is the difference between these two types of forecasts, and can we say anything about what can be reasonably be forecast and what can&amp;rsquo;t?</description>

      <title>Recursive and direct multi-step forecasting: the best of both worlds</title>
      <link>https://robjhyndman.com/publications/rectify/</link>

      <guid>https://robjhyndman.com/publications/rectify/</guid>
      <description>We propose a new forecasting strategy, called rectify, that seeks to combine the best properties of both the recursive and direct forecasting strategies. The rationale behind the rectify strategy is to begin with biased recursive forecasts and adjust them so they are unbiased and have smaller error. We use linear and nonlinear simulated time series to investigate the performance of the rectify strategy and compare the results with those from the recursive and the direct strategies.</description>

      <description>This week I&amp;rsquo;m in Cyprus attending the COMPSTAT2012 conference. There&amp;rsquo;s been the usual interesting collection of talks, and interactions with other researchers. But I was struck by two side comments in talks this morning that I&amp;rsquo;d like to mention.
Stephen Pollock: Don&amp;rsquo;t imagine your model is the truth Actually, Stephen said something like &amp;ldquo;economists (or was it econometricians?) have a bad habit of imagining their models are true&amp;rdquo;. He gave the example of people asking whether GDP &amp;ldquo;has a unit root&amp;rdquo;?</description>

      <description>About once a week someone will tell me there is a bug in my forecast package for R because it gives forecasts that are the same for all future horizons. To save answering the same question repeatedly, here is my response.
A point forecast is (usually) the mean of the distribution of a future observation in the time series, conditional on the past observations of the time series. It is possible, even likely in some circumstances, that the future observations will have the same mean and then the forecast function is flat.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve just finished another reviewer report for a journal, and yet again I&amp;rsquo;ve had to make comments about reading the literature. It&amp;rsquo;s not difficult. Before you write a paper, read what other people have done. A simple search on Google scholar will usually do the trick. And before you submit a paper, check again that you haven&amp;rsquo;t missed anything important.
The paper I reviewed today did not cite a single reference from either of the two most active research groups in the area in the last ten years.</description>

      <description>I have argued previously that research papers should be posted online at the same time as they are submitted to a journal. Sometimes people claim that journals don&amp;rsquo;t allow it, which is nonsense. Almost every journal allows it, and many also allow the published version of a paper to appear on your personal website.
Today I discovered a new tool (thanks to the IMU newsletter) which makes it easy to check a journal&amp;rsquo;s policy on this.</description>

      <description>Beamer is far and away the most popular software for presentations amongst researchers in mathematics and statistics. Most conference and seminar talks I attend these days use beamer. Unfortunately, they all look much the same. I think people find beamer themes too hard to modify easily, so a small number of templates get shared around. Even the otherwise wonderful LaTeX Templates site has no beamer examples.
The beamer user guide explains how to make changes but it is not for the faint-hearted (although it is a fantastic resource once you have some expertise).</description>

      <description>Background: Few case-control studies of time dependent environmental exposures and respiratory outcomes have been performed. Small sample sizes pose modeling challenges for estimating interactions. In contrast, case cross-over studies are well suited where control selection and responses are low, time consuming and costly.
Objective: To demonstrate the feasibility and validity of a case crossover study of children admitted to hospital for asthma to examine interacting effects of time varying environmental exposures.</description>

      <description>Invited talk, Australian Statistical Conference, Adelaide, 10 July 2012.
 COMPSTAT 2012, Cyprus, 29 August 2012. Seminar, Lancaster University, 10 September 2012.  Many applications require a large number of time series to be forecast completely automatically. For example, manufacturing companies often require weekly forecasts of demand for thousands of products at dozens of locations in order to plan distribution and maintain suitable inventory stocks. In population forecasting, there are often a few hundred time series to be forecast, representing various components that make up the population dynamics.</description>

      <description>This post is from my new book Forecasting: principles and practice, available freely online at OTexts.org/fpp/.
A non-seasonal ARIMA model can be written as \begin{equation}\label{eq:c} (1-\phi_1B - \cdots - \phi_p B^p)(1-B)^d y_t = c + (1 + \theta_1 B + \cdots + \theta_q B^q)e_t \end{equation} or equivalently as \begin{equation}\label{eq:mu} (1-\phi_1B - \cdots - \phi_p B^p)(1-B)^d (y_t - \mu t^d/d!) = (1 + \theta_1 B + \cdots + \theta_q B^q)e_t, \end{equation} where $B$ is the backshift operator, $c = \mu(1-\phi_1 - \cdots - \phi_p )$ and $\mu$ is the mean of $(1-B)^d y_t$.</description>

      <description>A very useful way of keeping up with blogs in a particular area is to subscribe to a blog aggregator. These will syndicate posts from a large number of blogs and provide links back to the original sources. So you only need to subscribe once to get all the good stuff in that area.
There are now several blog aggregators available that might be of interest to readers here. And this blog is now syndicated on several other sites including those listed below.</description>

      <description>Every day I receive emails, or comments on this blog, asking for help with R, forecasting, LaTeX, possible research topics, how to install software, or some other thing I&amp;rsquo;m supposed to know something about. Unfortunately, I cannot provide a one-man help service to the rest of the world. I used to reply to all the requests explaining where to go for help, but I stopped replying a while ago as it took too much time to do even that.</description>

      <description>A few years ago, I was working on a project where we measured various characteristics of a time series and used the information to determine what forecasting method to apply or how to cluster the time series into meaningful groups. The two main papers to come out of that project were:
Wang, Smith and Hyndman (2006) Characteristic-​​based clustering for time series data. Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery, 13(3), 335-364.
 Wang, Smith-Miles and Hyndman (2009) “Rule induction for forecasting method selection: meta-​​learning the characteristics of univariate time series”, Neurocomputing, 72, 2581-2594.</description>

      <description>Google has produced another great tool for researchers, this time providing some metrics on journal citations. Google Scholar Metrics allows you to search on journals rather than articles, and to see the average or median h-index for each journal.
For example, a search on &amp;ldquo;forecasting&amp;rdquo; yields the following results:

The h-index is the largest number $h$ such that at least $h$ articles in that publication were cited at least $h$ times each.</description>

To salvage some sense of self-worth, you can then head over to Solomon Messing&amp;rsquo;s blog where he is starting a series on data visualization based on the principles developed by Tufte and Cleveland (with R examples).
The classics are also worth reading, and remain relevant despite the 20 or 30 years that have elapsed since they appeared.</description>

      <description>I have thought quite a lot about including regressors (i.e. covariates) in exponential smoothing (ETS) models, and I have done it a couple of times in my published work. See my 2008 exponential smoothing book (chapter 9) and my 2008 Tourism Management paper. However, there are some theoretical issues with these approaches, which have come to light through the research of Ahmad Farid Osman, one of our PhD students at Monash University.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a new StackExchange site that might be useful to readers: Academia. It is a Q&amp;amp;A site for academics and those enrolled in higher education.
The draft FAQ says it will cover:
 Life as a graduate student, postdoctoral researcher, university professor
 Transitioning from undergraduate to graduate researcher
 Inner workings of research departments
 Requirements and expectations of academicians
  Judging from the first 89 questions, this is going to be extremely helpful, especially for PhD students.</description>

      <description>Staying in touch with other researchers is important.

A long list of lists in econometrics and statistics is provided by EconometricLinks. Browse through it to find topics of interest. No doubt researchers in other disciplines have their own lists, but I don&amp;rsquo;t know about them.
For those in Australia and New Zealand, there are two local lists that every statistician and econometrician should be on:</description>

      <description>Almost every research paper and thesis in statistics contains at least some tables, yet students are rarely taught how to make good tables. While the principles of good graphics are slowly becoming part of a statistical education (although not an econometrics education!), the principles of good tables are often ignored. Perhaps people think they are obvious, although the results I see in papers and theses suggest otherwise.Lately the topic seems to have been getting some much-needed attention and the following resources may be useful.</description>

      <title>Short-term load forecasting based on a semi-parametric additive model</title>
      <link>https://robjhyndman.com/publications/stlf/</link>

      <description>Short-term load forecasting is an essential instrument in power system planning, operation and control. Many operating decisions are based on load forecasts, such as dispatch scheduling of generating capacity, reliability analysis, and maintenance planning for the generators. Overestimation of electricity demand will cause a conservative operation, which leads to the start-up of too many units or excessive energy purchase, thereby supplying an unnecessary level of reserve. On the contrary, underestimation may result in a risky operation, with insufficient preparation of spinning reserve, causing the system to operate in a vulnerable region to the disturbance.</description>

      <description>A great new feature has been added to Google Scholar Citations. For those authors who have set up a citations page, it is now possible to get email alerts for any new articles they publish, or for any new citations of their articles. So you can track citations to your own work this way, and stay up-to-date with key authors in your field.
Setting up a Google Citations page is super-easy and was already worth doing.</description>

      <description>Background: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is currently the fifth leading cause of death in Australia, and there are marked differences in mortality trends between men and women. In this study, we have sought to model and forecast age related changes in COPD mortality over time for men and women separately over the period 2006–2025.
Methods: Annual COPD death rates in Australia from 1922 to 2005 for age groups (50–54, 55–59, 60–64, 65–69, 70–74, 75–79, 80–84, 85+) were used.</description>

      <description>A new innovations state space modeling framework, incorporating Box-Cox transformations, Fourier series with time varying coefficients and ARMA error correction, is introduced for forecasting complex seasonal time series that cannot be handled using existing forecasting models. Such complex time series include time series with multiple seasonal periods, high frequency seasonality, non-integer seasonality and dual-calendar effects. Our new modelling framework provides an alternative to existing exponential smoothing models, and is shown to have many advantages.</description>

      <description>I gave this talk on Forecasting time series using R for the Melbourne Users of R Network (MelbURN) on Thursday 27 October 2011.
Slides Examples
Abstract I look at the various facilities for time series forecasting available in R, concentrating on the forecast package. This package implements several automatic methods for forecasting time series including forecasts from ARIMA models, ARFIMA models and exponential smoothing models. I also look more generally at how to go about forecasting non-seasonal data, seasonal data, seasonal data with high frequency, and seasonal data with multiple frequencies.</description>

      <description>These terms get confused all the time (e.g., this question on CrossValidated.com), and so I thought it might be helpful to try to summarize the distinction and some of the associated models.Definitions A seasonal pattern exists when a series is influenced by seasonal factors (e.g., the quarter of the year, the month, or day of the week). Seasonality is always of a fixed and known period. Hence, seasonal time series are sometimes called periodic time series.</description>

      <description>A researcher portal is a website that attempts to list all the publications of a given researcher. Some portals also allow sharing papers, interacting with other researchers, calculating citation statistics, etc. Every researcher wants their work read and cited, so these websites can be useful tools for getting your work noticed. They can also function as a de facto home page if you don&amp;rsquo;t already have a personal website. Conversely, they can be a good way to find new work by researchers in your field.</description>

Particular topics they named included real analysis, functional analysis, measure theory, algebra, linear algebra. That would have been my response also. I still wish I knew more mathematics than I do. I did quite a lot of mathematics as an undergraduate, but every year I need to learn some more.</description>

 University of Melbourne, 11 October 2011. University of Adelaide, 16 March 2012 Monash University, 16 May 2012 La Trobe University, 24 May 2012 EDF, Paris. 4 September 2012 University of New South Wales, 1 November 2012  Abstract: Electricity demand forecasting plays an important role in short-term load allocation and long-term planning for future generation facilities and transmission augmentation. Planners must adopt a probabilistic view of potential peak demand levels, therefore density forecasts (providing estimates of the full probability distributions of the possible future values of the demand) are more helpful than point forecasts, and are necessary for utilities to evaluate and hedge the financial risk accrued by demand variability and forecasting uncertainty.</description>

As much as I&amp;rsquo;d like to provide a free forecasting advice service to the world, that&amp;rsquo;s not what I&amp;rsquo;m paid to do, and I choose to spend my unpaid time on other things. However, there are some very helpful resources available for forecasting practitioners.First, every practicing forecaster should be reading Foresight. It is far and away the best journal or magazine for forecast practitioners.</description>

      <description>Academic publishing is built on an old model where publishers were needed to print and distribute journals to libraries. Under this system, it makes sense that the journals are distributed by publishing companies who charge fees for their work. On the other hand, the academics who write for the journals, the peer reviewers and (almost all) editors, have always contributed their time and expertise without cost. Essentially, they are being paid by universities and other research organizations to do this work.</description>

      <description>I was recently asked how to implement time series cross-validation in R. Time series people would normally call this &amp;ldquo;forecast evaluation with a rolling origin&amp;rdquo; or something similar, but it is the natural and obvious analogue to leave-one-out cross-validation for cross-sectional data, so I prefer to call it &amp;ldquo;time series cross-validation&amp;rdquo;.Here is some example code applying time series CV and comparing 1-step, 2-step, &amp;hellip;, 12-step forecasts using the Mean Absolute Error (MAE).</description>

      <description>The forecast package for R has undergone a major upgrade, and I&amp;rsquo;ve given it version number 3 as a result. Some of these changes were suggestions from the forecasting workshop I ran in Switzerland a couple of months ago, and some have been on the drawing board for a long time. Here are the main changes in version 3, plus a few earlier additions that I thought deserved a mention.</description>

Their goal is to develop methods for aggregating many individual judgments in a manner that yields more accurate predictions than any one person or small group alone could provide. Potential applications of the system include forecasting economic conditions, political changes, technological development and medical breakthroughs. They are currently seeking to recruit individuals who have interest (and/or expertise) in any of a wide range of current affairs, including but not limited to politics, economics, technology, military affairs, social trends, and science and technology.</description>

      <description>Andrew Ng&amp;rsquo;s machine learning course at Stanford is being offered free to anyone online in the (northern) fall of 2011. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen some of the notes from this course and it looks to be an excellent broad introduction to machine learning and data mining. For example, support vector machines, neural networks, kernels, clustering, dimension reduction, etc.Statisticians should know something about this area (just as computer scientists working in machine learning should know some statistical modelling), and this would be a great way to learn it.</description>

      <description>Survey articles are particularly helpful in getting a foothold in a new research area, or in looking for important papers that you may have overlooked. Whatever area of research you are in, look out for survey papers and journals dedicated to publishing survey papers.The journal Statistics Surveys is relatively new (volume 1 in 2007) and provides very helpful survey articles of areas of statistical research. It is sponsored by the American Statistical Association, the Bernoulli Society, the Institute of Mathematical Statistics, and by the Statistical Society of Canada.</description>

CrossValidated.com is great for specific questions, but is not suitable for commenting on papers or sharing ideas and links.Although I have a facebook account, this seems the wrong place to carry out a research discussion because my family and friends are generally not interested, and it is messy to restrict posts to groups of friends.</description>

      <description>The influence of synoptic-scale circulations on air quality is an area of increasing interest to air quality management in regards to future climate change. This study presents an analysis where the dominant synoptic &amp;lsquo;types&amp;rsquo; over the region of Melbourne, Australia are determined and linked to regional air quality. First, a self-organising map (SOM) is used to generate a time series of synoptic charts that classify the annual daily circulation affecting Melbourne into 20 different synoptic types.</description>

      <title>Point and interval forecasts of mortality rates and life expectancy: a comparison of ten principal component methods</title>

      <guid>https://robjhyndman.com/publications/mortality-forecast-comparison/</guid>
      <description>Abstract: Using the age- and sex-specific data of 14 developed countries, we compare the point and interval forecast accuracy and bias of ten principal component methods for forecasting mortality rates and life expectancy. The ten methods are variants and extensions of the Lee-Carter method. Based on one-step forecast errors, the weighted Hyndman-Ullah method provides the most accurate point forecasts of mortality rates and the Lee-Miller method is the least biased. For the accuracy and bias of life expectancy, the weighted Hyndman-Ullah method performs the best for female mortality and the Lee-Miller method for male mortality.</description>

      <title>Method for optimizing coating properties based on an evolutionary algorithm approach</title>

      <description>In industry as well as many areas of scientific research, data collected often contain a number of responses of interest for a chosen set of exploratory variables. Optimization of such multivariable multiresponse systems is a challenge well suited to genetic algorithms as global optimization tools. One such example is the optimization of coating surfaces with the required absolute and relative sensitivity for detecting analytes using devices such as sensor arrays. High-throughput synthesis and screening methods can be used to accelerate materials discovery and optimization; however, an important practical consideration for successful optimization of materials for arrays and other applications is the ability to generate adequate information from a minimum number of experiments.</description>

      <description>In this paper, the price elasticity of electricity demand, representing the sensitivity of customer demand to the price of electricity, has been estimated for South Australia. We first undertake a review of the scholarly literature regarding electricity price elasticity for different regions and systems. Then we perform an empirical evaluation of the historic South Australian price elasticity, focussing on the relationship between price and demand quantiles at each half-hour of the day.</description>

      <guid>https://robjhyndman.com/publications/hierarchical/</guid>
      <description>In many applications, there are multiple time series that are hierarchically organized and can be aggregated at several different levels in groups based on products, geography or some other features. We call these &amp;ldquo;hierarchical time series&amp;rdquo;. They are commonly forecast using either a &amp;ldquo;bottom-up&amp;rdquo; or a &amp;ldquo;top-down&amp;rdquo; method.
In this paper we propose a new approach to hierarchical forecasting which provides optimal forecasts that are better than forecasts produced by either a top-down or a bottom-up approach.</description>

 I’m using ARIMA with Intervention detection and was planning to use your package to identify my initial ARIMA model for later iteration, however I found that sometimes the auto.arima function returns a model where AR/MA coefficients are not significant. So my question is: Is there a way to filter the search for ARIMA models that only have significant coefficients. I can remove the non-significant coefficients but I think it would be better to search for those models that only have significant coefficients.</description>

      <title>Improved interval estimation of long run response from a dynamic linear model: a highest density region approach</title>

      <guid>https://robjhyndman.com/publications/dlm-hdr/</guid>
      <description>This paper proposes a new method of interval estimation for the long run response (or elasticity) parameter from a general linear dynamic model. We employ the bias-corrected bootstrap, in which small sample biases associated with the parameter estimators are adjusted in two stages of the bootstrap. As a means of bias-correction, we use alternative analytic and bootstrap methods. To take atypical properties of the long run elasticity estimator into account, the highest density region (HDR) method is adopted for the construction of confidence intervals.</description>

      <description>Abstract We present a nonparametric method to forecast a seasonal univariate time series, and propose four dynamic updating methods to improve point forecast accuracy. Our methods consider a seasonal univariate time series as a functional time series. We propose first to reduce the dimensionality by applying functional principal component analysis to the historical observations, and then to use univariate time series forecasting and functional principal component regression techniques. When data in the most recent year are partially observed, we improve point forecast accuracy using dynamic updating methods.</description>

The results show that feedback significantly improves forecasting accuracy.</description>

      <description>With the constant pressure on academics to publish research papers, there is a temptation for research groups to include &amp;ldquo;coauthors&amp;rdquo; who have not really made any contribution to the manuscript. This seems more prevalent in some fields (e.g., the health sciences) than others.
Occasionally, I am asked to add an author to a paper that has already been accepted for publication in the International Journal of Forecasting. I am very reluctant to do this as it is hard to imagine how someone could be left off a paper while it goes through several revisions, only to be remembered after the paper is accepted.</description>

      <description>We evaluate the performance of various methods for forecasting tourism demand. The data used include 366 monthly series, 427 quarterly series and 518 yearly series, all supplied to us by tourism bodies or by academics from previous tourism forecasting studies. The forecasting methods implemented in the competition are univariate and multivariate time series approaches, and econometric models. This forecasting competition differs from previous competitions in several ways: (i) we concentrate only on tourism demand data; (ii) we include approaches with explanatory variables; (iii) we evaluate the forecast interval coverage as well as point forecast accuracy; (iv) we observe the effect of temporal aggregation on forecasting accuracy; and (v) we consider the mean absolute scaled error as an alternative forecasting accuracy measure.</description>

This paper presents the estimated response of ozone (O3), particulate matter ≤ 10 μm (PM10), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) to individual local meteorological variables in Melbourne, Australia over the period of 1999 to 2006. The relationships have been quantified after controlling for long-term trends, seasonality, weekly emissions, spatial variation, and temporal persistence using the framework of a generalized additive modelling (GAM).</description>

Hans Rosling again: &amp;rdquo;Let my dataset change your mindset&amp;rdquo;. If only all statistics lecturers were this dynamic!
  David McCandless: &amp;ldquo;The beauty of data visualization&amp;rdquo;. Not so exciting as Hans, but some great examples.
  And here&amp;rsquo;s an hour-length documentary hosted by Hans Rosling called &amp;ldquo;The Joy of Stats&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>The Holt-Winters method is a popular and effective approach to forecasting seasonal time series. But different implementations will give different forecasts, depending on how the method is initialized and how the smoothing parameters are selected. In this post I will discuss various initialization methods.
Suppose the time series is denoted by $y_1,\dots,y_n$ and the seasonal period is $m$ (e.g., $m=12$ for monthly data). Let $\hat{y}_{t+h|t}$ be the $h$-step forecast made using data to time $t$.</description>

      <description>Every researcher needs a Curriculum Vitae (Latin for &amp;ldquo;course of life&amp;rdquo;) or CV. You will need it for job applications, for annual performance appraisal, and just for keeping track of your publications. A CV typically contains lists of achievements including qualifications, publications, presentations, awards, plus teaching experience.
I&amp;rsquo;ve created a LaTeX style for a CV to make it easy to produce something that looks good and is easy to maintain. You will need an up-to-date implementation of LaTeX because I&amp;rsquo;m using the wonderful biblatex package (more on that in another post) which has only just become available as part of MikTeX and TeXLive.</description>

      <description>Summary  R is a free open source statistical computing environment which can be used for forecasting. It is available at www.r-project.org. Advantages of R include its (zero) price, the large number of user-contributed packages, its production-quality graphics and the possibility of extending it by linking fast compiled C/C++/Fortran code. Disadvantages of R include a steep learning curve and a certain slowness when dealing with truly massive amounts of data.</description>

      <title>The vector innovations structural time series framework: a simple approach to multivariate forecasting</title>
      <link>https://robjhyndman.com/publications/vists/</link>

      <guid>https://robjhyndman.com/publications/vists/</guid>
      <description>The vector innovations structural time series framework is proposed as a way of modelling a set of related time series. Like all multivariate approaches, the aim is to exploit potential inter-series dependencies to improve the fit and forecasts. The model is based around an unobserved vector of components representing features such as the level and slope of each time series. Equations that describe the evolution of these components through time are used to represent the inter-temporal dependencies.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve had a few emails lately about forecast evaluation and estimation criteria. Here is one I received today, along with some comments.
 I have a rather simple question regarding the use of MSE as opposed to MAD and MAPE. If the parameters of a time series model are estimated by minimizing MSE, why do we evaluate the model using some other metric, e.g., MAD and MAPE. I could see that MAPE is not scale dependent.</description>

First, read the instructions on how to apply.
Second, poke around my website to see the sorts of topics I work on. There&amp;rsquo;s no point asking to do a PhD with me if you want to do research on something I don&amp;rsquo;t know much about. In particular, please note that I&amp;rsquo;m not really interested in finance or economics.</description>

 I use Eviews to estimate time series, but I have been checking out R recently, and your Forecast package.
I cannot understand why 2 similar equations in Eviews and R are giving different estimated output. Your insights will be invaluable for my work.
The equations are:

XeLaTeX is essentially a replacement for pdfLaTeX. It was primarily developed to enable better font handling, especially non-Roman scripts. If you want to write in Telugu, then XeLaTeX is going to make your life much easier.</description>

Perhaps it is because the date is 20.10.2010 (except in North America where it is 10.20.2010). But then, what happens from 2013 to 2099? And do we just forget the whole idea after 3112?
In any case, if we are going to have a WSD, let&amp;rsquo;s use it to do something useful.</description>

      <description>This was the topic of a recent conversation on the Australian and New Zealand R mailing list. Here is an edited list of some of the comments made.
 R is free.
 R is well-documented.
 R runs (really well) on *nix as well as Windows and Mac OS.
 R is open-source. Trust in the R software is evident by its support among distinguished statisticians. However, the R user need not rely on trust, as the source code for R is freely available for public scrutiny.</description>

      <description>There is often confusion about how to include covariates in ARIMA models, and the presentation of the subject in various textbooks and in R help files has not helped the confusion. So I thought I&amp;rsquo;d give my take on the issue. To keep it simple, I will only describe non-seasonal ARIMA models although the ideas are easily extended to include seasonal terms. I will include only one covariate in the models although it is easy to extend the results to multiple covariates.</description>

      <title>Why every statistician should know about cross-validation</title>

      <guid>https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/crossvalidation/</guid>
      <description>Surprisingly, many statisticians see cross-validation as something data miners do, but not a core statistical technique. I thought it might be helpful to summarize the role of cross-validation in statistics, especially as it is proposed that the Q&amp;amp;A site at stats.stackexchange.com should be renamed CrossValidated.com.
Cross-validation is primarily a way of measuring the predictive performance of a statistical model. Every statistician knows that the model fit statistics are not a good guide to how well a model will predict: high $R^2$ does not necessarily mean a good model.</description>

      <description>I am often asked how to fit an ARIMA or ETS model with data having a long seasonal period such as 365 for daily data or 48 for half-hourly data. Generally, seasonal versions of ARIMA and ETS models are designed for shorter periods such as 12 for monthly data or 4 for quarterly data.
The ets() function in the forecast package restricts seasonality to be a maximum period of 24 to allow hourly data but not data with a larger seasonal frequency.</description>

      <description>Every week I reject papers submitted to the International Journal of Forecasting because they present new methods without ever attempting to demonstrate that the new methods are better than existing methods. It is a policy of the journal that every new method must be compared to standard benchmarks and existing methods before the paper will even be considered for publication.
For univariate time series methods, it is not difficult. As a minimum, comparisons should be made against a naive method and a standard method such as an ARIMA model.</description>

      <description>A challenge in phenology studies is understanding what constitutes significant phenological change amidst background variation (e.g. noise) and ecosystem disturbances (e.g. fires). The majority of phenological studies have focussed on extracting critical points in the seasonal growth cycle (e.g. Start-of-spring), without exploiting the full temporal detail. Moreover, the high degree of phenological variability between years demonstrates the necessity of distinguishing long term phenological change from temporal variability. Here, we evaluate the phenological change detection ability of a method for detecting Breaks For Additive Seasonal and Trend (BFAST).</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m currently working with a hydrologist and he raised a question that occurs quite frequently with real data &amp;mdash; what do you do when the data look like they need a log transformation, but there are zero values?
I asked the question on stats.stackexchange.com and received some useful suggestions. What follows is a summary based on these answers, my own experience, plus a few papers I discovered that deal with the topic.</description>

      <description>Recently I wrote a paper entitled &amp;ldquo;The tourism forecasting competition&amp;rdquo; in which we (i.e., George Athanasopoulos, Haiyan Song, Doris Wu and I) compared various forecasting methods on a relatively large set of tourism-related time series. The paper has been accepted for publication in the International Journal of Forecasting. (When I submit a paper to the IJF it is always handled by another editor. In this case, Mike Clements handled the paper and it went through several revisions before it was finally accepted.</description>

      <description>One of the things I repeatedly include in referee reports, and in my responses to authors who have submitted papers to the International Journal of Forecasting, are comments designed to include the quality of the graphics. Recently someone asked on stats.stackexchange.com aboutbest practices for producing plots. So I thought it might be helpful to collate some of the answers given there and add a few comments of my own taken from things I&amp;rsquo;ve written for authors.</description>

      <description>We survey some graphical tools for visualizing large sets of functional data represented by smooth curves. These graphical tools include the phase-plane plot, singular value decomposition plot, rainbow plot, functional variants of the bagplot and the highest density region boxplot. The latter two techniques utilize the first two robust principal component scores, Tukey&amp;rsquo;s halfspace location depth and highest density regions.
The computer code and datasets are collected in the rainbow package for R, which is available at the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN).</description>

      <title>Short-term load forecasting based on a semi-parametric additive model</title>

      <description>Short-term load forecasting is an essential instrument in power system planning, operation and control. Many operating decisions are based on load forecasts, such as dispatch scheduling of generating capacity, reliability analysis, and maintenance planning for the generators. Overestimation of electricity demand will cause a conservative operation, which leads to the start-up of too many units or excessive energy purchase, thereby supplying an unnecessary level of reserve. On the contrary, underestimation may result in a risky operation, with insufficient preparation of spinning reserve, causing the system to operate in a vulnerable region to the disturbance.</description>

      <description>It seems that most journals no longer do any serious copy-editing, and the standard of English is falling. Today I was reading an article from the European Journal of Operational Research, which is supposedly a good OR journal (current impact factor over 2). Take this for an example from the first page of this paper:
 If the learned patterns are unstable, the learning tools would produce inconsistent concepts. To overcome this difficult situation, we employed artificial neural networks (ANNs, NNs) for helping the learning task.</description>

      <description>It is very unusual for a newspaper article to cite an academic paper, unless it is in Nature, Science or the Lancet. Mostly, what we write is too technical and assumes too much background knowledge for it to be accessible to anyone but specialists. So I was pleasantly surprised to find a reference to the International Journal of Forecastingin a recent Wall Street Journalarticle. It is a citation of a 1996 article, so in terms of scientific research it is a bit like quoting the Magna Carta, but a citation nevertheless.</description>

      <guid>https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/use-fake-data-and-real-data/</guid>
      <description>When developing new statistical methods, it is very useful to test them on both fake data (i.e., simulations) and real data.
Testing on fake data is useful because then you know the &amp;ldquo;true&amp;rdquo; answer and can check the procedure under ideal conditions. If your method doesn&amp;rsquo;t work when the data are designed for the task, it is unlikely to work in real conditions. Fake data also enables you to test the robustness of your method when the conditions aren&amp;rsquo;t perfect &amp;ndash; for example, try adding some nasty outliers and see if the method still works.</description>

      <description>There seems to be two points of view on this with different practices in different disciplines.
 Some researchers do not make their work public until after it has been accepted for publication in a journal. Until that time, drafts of papers are only circulated to close confidants and usually marked &amp;ldquo;Do not distribute&amp;rdquo;.
 Working papers are published on web sites and in web repositories (such as arXiv or RePEc) as soon as they are finished, at about the same time they are submitted to a journal.</description>

      <description>The disparity in breast cancer mortality rates among white and black US women is widening, with higher mortality rates among black women. We apply functional time series models on age-specific breast cancer mortality rates for each group of women, and forecast their mortality curves using exponential smoothing state-space models with damping. The data were obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program of the US. Mortality data were obtained from the National Centre for Health Statistics (NCHS) available on the SEER*Stat database.</description>

By-products of our graphical displays are outlier detection methods for functional data. We compare these new outlier detection methods with existing methods for detecting outliers in functional data and show that our methods are better able to identify the outliers.</description>

      <description>There are several reasons why researchers should be willing to provide referee reports.
 You learn a lot. If the paper is in your area, then writing a referee report forces you to read it very carefully and engage closely with the research of other people in your field. There&amp;rsquo;s no better way of understand what is going on in your field.
 You get better known by the research leaders in your area.</description>

      <description>As an editor, I like to see referee reports comprising three sections:
 A general summary of the paper and the contribution it makes. You need to highlight here what is new and interesting about the paper, as well as give a summary in a few sentences.
 The major problems that need addressing. This is probably the most important section of your report where you explain the main problems. The editor will read this very carefully when deciding whether to accept, reject or invite a revision, so you need to make sure that any problems are clearly explained here.</description>

The aim of the methodology is to face the challenging aspects of the problem: high dimensional variable space, constraints on the independent variables, multiple responses, expensive or time-consuming experimental trials, expected complexity of the functional relationships between independent and response variables. The proposed approach iteratively select a set of experiments by combining a multiobjective Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and a multiresponse Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spines (MARS) model.</description>

      <description>Background: Mortality/incidence predictions are used for planning public health resources and need to accurately reflect age-related changes through time. We present a new forecasting model to estimate future trends in age-related breast cancer mortality for the United States and England-Wales.
Material and methods: We use functional data analysis techniques to model breast cancer mortality-age relationships in the United States from 1950 to 2001 and England-Wales from 1950 to 2003, and estimate 20-year predictions using a new forecasting method.</description>

      <title>Detecting trend and seasonal changes in satellite image time series</title>

      <description>A wealth of remotely sensed time series covering large areas is now available to the earth science community. Change detection methods are often not capable of detecting land cover changes within time series that are heavily influenced by seasonal climatic variations. Detecting change within the trend and seasonal components of time series enables the detection of different types of changes. Changes occurring in the trend component indicate disturbances (e.g., insect attack), while changes occurring in the seasonal component indicate phenological changes (e.</description>

      <title>Density forecasting for long-term peak electricity demand</title>
      <link>https://robjhyndman.com/publications/peak-electricity-demand/</link>

      <description>Abstract: Long-term electricity demand forecasting plays an important role in planning for future generation facilities and transmission augmentation. In a long term context, planners must adopt a probabilistic view of potential peak demand levels, therefore density forecasts (providing estimates of the full probability distributions of the possible future values of the demand) are more helpful than point forecasts, and are necessary for utilities to evaluate and hedge the financial risk accrued by demand variability and forecasting uncertainty.</description>

      <description>Almost all papers these days have a DOI and it is worth knowing how to use them.
At the top or bottom of the first page of a paper, you will see something like this:
doi:10.1016/j.csda.2006.07.028  This is a unique and permanent identifier for the paper known as a &amp;ldquo;Digital Object Identifier&amp;rdquo;. The part before the forward slash (10.1016 in the example above) identifies the naming authority (in this case Elsevier) and the part after the forward slash (j.</description>

      <description>Reproducible research One of the best ways to get started with research in a new area is to try to replicate some existing research. In doing so, you will usually gain a much better understanding of the topic, and you will often discover some problems with the research, or develop ideas that will lead to a new research paper.
Unfortunately, a lot of papers are not reproducible because the data are not made available, or the description of the methods are not detailed enough.</description>

      <description>The most common forecasting methods in business are based on exponential smoothing and the most common time series in business are inherently non-negative. Therefore it is of interest to consider the properties of the potential stochastic models underlying exponential smoothing when applied to non-negative data. We explore exponential smoothing state space models for non-negative data under various assumptions about the innovations, or error, process.
We first demonstrate that prediction distributions from some commonly used state space models may have an infinite variance beyond a certain forecasting horizon.</description>

      <title>Controlling figure and table placement in LaTeX</title>

      <description>It can be frustrating trying to get your figures and tables to appear where you want them in a LaTeX document. Sometimes, they just seem to float off onto another page of their own accord. Here is a collection of tools and ideas that help you get control of those pesky floats.Use the placement options: h, t, b and p. For example
\begin{figure}[htb]  causes LaTeX to try to fit the float &amp;ldquo;here&amp;rdquo;, or at the &amp;ldquo;top&amp;rdquo; of the current page (or the next page), or at the &amp;ldquo;bottom&amp;rdquo; of the current page (or the next page).</description>

      <description>Check out the two posts by Galit Shmueli over at Bzst on hypothesis tests: one on the value of p-values and another on one-sided tests.
She says &amp;ldquo;Shockingly enough, people seem to really want to use p-values, even if they don&amp;rsquo;t understand them.&amp;rdquo; That mirrors my experience too. Confidence intervals are much more useful because they provide a measure of the size of an effect, rather than testing if it is equal to some prespecified value.</description>

      <description>Should you use &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;we&amp;rdquo; or neither in your thesis or paper?
Thoughts on this have changed over the years. Traditionally, using personal pronouns like &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;we&amp;rdquo; was frowned on. Instead of saying &amp;ldquo;In Section 3, I have compared the results from method X with those of method Y&amp;rdquo;, you were expected to write &amp;ldquo;In section 3, the results from method X are compared with those from method Y&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <guid>https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/attending-research-seminars/</guid>
      <description>Most research students don&amp;rsquo;t seem to attend seminars. When asked, they usually say the seminars are not on their topic, or they don&amp;rsquo;t understand them, or they find them boring, or some other similar reason. I think this is because students don&amp;rsquo;t understand the purpose of research seminars, and have not learned how to listen to them.
Admittedly, many research seminars are badly presented, and seminar speakers also frequently misunderstand the purpose of the seminar, which makes the problem worse.</description>

No, I can&amp;rsquo;t just change the font as it has to be 12 point with at least 2 cm margins on an A4 page. Fortunately, LaTeX is packed full of powerful features that help in squeezing it all in. Here are some of the tips I&amp;rsquo;ve used over the years.</description>

      <description>Simply include the package epstopdf. Then when you use pdflatex, the eps files will be automatically converted to pdf at compile time. (The conversion only happens the first time you process the file, and is skipped if there is already a pdf file with the same name.)
For example:
\documentclass{article} \usepackage{graphicx,epstopdf} \begin{document} \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{fig1} \end{document}  Then even though the only graphics file available is fig1.eps, this will still be processed ok using pdflatex or pdftexify.</description>

Thinkwell is an Australian company offering a seminar and associated work book on &amp;ldquo;The 7 secrets of highly successful PhD students&amp;rdquo;. I bought the book out of curiosity, but &amp;ldquo;book&amp;rdquo; is a gross exaggeration &amp;ndash; only eleven pages of fairly simplistic advice.

      <description>The abstract is probably the most important part of a paper. Many readers will not read anything else, so you need to grab their attention and get your main message across as clearly and succinctly as possible. It is not meant to be an introduction to the paper, but a summary of the paper. In a single paragraph, a reader can learn the purpose of the research, your general approach to the problem, your main results, and the most important conclusions.</description>

      <description>This came up recently on StackOverflow. One of the answers was particularly helpful and I thought it might be worth mentioning here. The idea presented there is to break the code into four files, all stored in your project directory. These four files are to be processed in the following order.
 load.R This file includes all code associated with loading the data. Usually, it will be a short file reading in data from files.</description>

      <description>Mathematics has its own particular conventions and rules when it comes to writing. There have been several attempts to write them down. The most famous is Halmos&amp;rsquo;s excellent essay &amp;ldquo;How to write mathematics&amp;rdquo;. Other good sources of advice are the following two books:
(I reviewed these two books in the Australian and New Zealand Journal of Statistics a few years ago.)

      <description>Occasionally, the best research is done in long periods of concentrated effort. Allegedly, Isaac Newton used to sometimes write for eight hours standing up without a break.
At other times, taking a break helps the research process. Think of Archimedes and his Eureka moment. Many of my best ideas come while walking, or taking a shower. In fact, I once suggested to my head of department that we should have showers installed in every office as it would increase the quality of our research.</description>

First, use help.search(&amp;quot;neural&amp;quot;) or the shorthand ??neural. This will search the help files of installed packages for the word &amp;ldquo;neural&amp;rdquo;. Actually, fuzzy matching is used so it returns pages that have words similar to &amp;ldquo;neural&amp;rdquo; such as &amp;ldquo;natural&amp;rdquo;. For a stricter search, use help.</description>

I believe there is a place for excellent teachers who do limited research within a strong research university, but their contribution is considerably enhanced if they share their teaching insights. There are at least three reputable research journals for publishing articles on statistics education:

He has been described as the &amp;ldquo;Mozart of mathematics&amp;rdquo; for his remarkable precocity and prolific output. The slides of his talk are available on his blog site.
It was an interesting talk, with excellent slides, marred only by the poor sound system and his bad habit of mumbling.</description>

I don&amp;rsquo;t know if it was connected or not, but on the same day a journalist (Richard Pullin) from Reuters phoned me to ask about assessing some economic forecasts. He wanted to compare the accuracy of several economic forecasts for Japan and he wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure how to go about it. I helped him to calculate the MASE for the different forecasts and the results have now been published.</description>

The slides are available here in presentation form or in handout form. Actually, these are an edited version of the slides as I accidentally left out a couple of the photographs in the workshop, and I&amp;rsquo;ve omitted slides that I didn&amp;rsquo;t end up covering in the workshop.</description>

I felt I was not going to be able to finish my thesis, and that I would be better off throwing in the towel and doing something else. Fortunately, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t think of anything better to do, plus I hate giving up on anything, so I persevered and it turned out ok.</description>

      <description>It may come as a shock to discover that a statistician does not like statistical tests. Isn&amp;rsquo;t that what statistics is all about? Unfortunately, in some disciplines statistical analysis does seem to consist almost entirely of hypothesis testing, and therein lies the problem.
The standard practice is to construct a hypothesis test to determine if some attribute of the data is &amp;ldquo;significant&amp;rdquo; or not, with the standard p-value threshold of 5%.</description>

      <description>Ever since I deleted the only copy of my honours thesis, one week before it was due to be handed in, I&amp;rsquo;ve been obsessive about backups, often to the amusement of my family and colleagues. But every time one of them loses a file or has a hard-disk fail, the smiles fade and they ask for advice.
I&amp;rsquo;ve used many systems over the years, each one a little better than the last.</description>

      <description>Forecasters are under the pump with a recession that many didn&amp;rsquo;t see coming. As I don&amp;rsquo;t do any macroeconomic forecasting, I can sit back and smile smugly at some of my colleagues while I work on simpler problems such as forecasting in epidemiology, demography and energy demand.
Some of those colleagues are cited in the Wall Street Journal today. The following quotation is interesting:
 The spate of cloudy crystal balls highlighted an uncomfortable reality about telling the future: It is hardest when it is most important.</description>

      <description>If you use LaTeX, then you probably have a bib file — a data base of all the papers and books that you have cited. It is much more efficient to keep one database in one location, than have multiple copies of it floating around your hard drive. (Or even worse, have different bib files created for different papers.) You might also have a few of your own style files, and again it is best to keep these in a central location and not have duplicates all over the place.</description>

      <description>There seems to be a widespread practice of researchers citing papers they have never even seen, let alone read. For example
 Some papers claim to do something new when it has already been done in one of the papers cited.
 Some articles are cited that apparently have little to do with the reason given for the citation, or which argue the opposite point of view to what is claimed.</description>

They are calling for submissions of prose, poetry or song which will &amp;ldquo;enhance people&amp;rsquo;s patriotic feelings, statistics and confidence&amp;rdquo;. Here is an English translation of the page.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been spending time writing response letters lately. I&amp;rsquo;ve also been reading lots of response letters from authors wanting their stuff published in the International Journal of Forecasting. I thought it might be useful to collate a few thoughts on the subject.
 No grovelling. I sometimes get response letters that start off with a paragraph of inane and obsequious fawning. The real response only begins after a paragraph of flattery which makes me wonder why I&amp;rsquo;ve never won the Nobel prize.</description>

      <description>All researchers need to maintain a database of papers they have read, cited, or simply noted for later reference. For those of us using LaTeX, the database is in the BibTeX format and is stored as a simple text file (a bib file) that can be edited using a text editor such as WinEdt.
But it is often easier to edit the file using specialist software. My current favourite tool is JabRef.</description>

      <description>All LaTeX users will sometimes need a symbol for which they don&amp;rsquo;t know the command. If you use WinEdt, there is a neat drop-down menu of some common symbols that can be helpful, but it is necessarily limited. What do you do when you want the male and female symbols?
For several years I&amp;rsquo;ve been using the comprehensive symbol list whenever I need a symbol in LaTeX that I can&amp;rsquo;t recall.</description>

      <guid>https://robjhyndman.com/publications/forecasting-functional-time-series-2/</guid>
      <description>We propose forecasting functional time series using weighted functional principal component regression and weighted functional partial least squares regression. These approaches allow for smooth functions, assign higher weights to more recent data, and provide a modeling scheme that is easily adapted to allow for constraints and other information. We illustrate our approaches using age-specific French female mortality rates from 1816 to 2006 and age-specific Australian fertility rates from 1921 to 2006, and show that these weighted methods improve forecast accuracy in comparison to their unweighted counterparts.</description>

      <description>Statistical process control (SPC) has evolved beyond its classical applications in manufacturing to monitoring economic and social phenomena. This extension requires consideration of autocorrelated and possibly non-stationary time series. Less attention has been paid to the possibility that the variance of the process may also change over time. In this paper we use the innovations state space modeling framework to develop conditionally heteroscedastic models. We provide examples to show that the incorrect use of homoscedastic models may lead to erroneous decisions about the nature of the process.</description>

      <description>Keynote address, International Symposium on Forecasting, June 2009. Abstract
Extremely bad data, extremely poor methods and extremely difficult problems will be used as the basis of some extremely useful lessons. I will describe three cases from my consulting experience and draw some general lessons that are widely applicable.
The first case involved forecasting passenger traffic on an Australian airline. The data showed variations due to school holidays, major sporting events, competitor activity, industrial disputes, changes in fare structures, and other factors.</description>

      <description>For univariate forecasting, there are various statistical models and computational algorithms available. In real-world exercises, too many choices can create difficulties in selecting the most appropriate technique, especially for users lacking sufficient knowledge of forecasting. This study focuses on rule induction for forecasting method selection by understanding the nature of historical forecasting data. A novel approach for selecting a forecasting method for univariate time series based on measurable data characteristics is presented that combines elements of data mining, meta-learning, clustering, classification and statistical measurement.</description>

      <description>In this paper we explore the hierarchical nature of tourism demand time series and produce short-term forecasts for Australian domestic tourism. The data and forecasts are organized in a hierarchy based on disaggregating the data for different geographical regions and for different purposes of travel. We consider five approaches to hierarchical forecasting: two variations of the top-down approach, the bottom-up method, a newly proposed top-down approach where top-level forecasts are disaggregated according to forecasted proportions of lower level series, and a recently proposed optimal combination approach.</description>

      <description>The Beveridge-Nelson vector innovations structural time series framework is a new formulation that decomposes a set of variables into their permanent and transitory components. The proposed framework is flexible, modelling inter-series relationships and common features in a simple manner. In particular, it is shown that this new specification is simpler than conventional state space and cointegration approaches. The approach is illustrated using a trivariate data set comprising the GDP of Australia, the USA and the UK.</description>

      <guid>https://robjhyndman.com/publications/multiple-seasonal-patterns/</guid>
      <description>A new approach is proposed for forecasting a time series with multiple seasonal patterns. A state space model is developed for the series using the innovation approach which enables us to develop explicit models for both additive and multiplicative seasonality. Parameter estimates may be obtained using methods from exponential smoothing. The proposed model is used to examine hourly and daily patterns in hourly data for both utility loads and traffic flows.</description>

      <description>Statistical significance testing has little useful purpose in business forecasting, and other tools are to be preferred. For selecting or ranking forecasting methods (especially those based on models) there exist simple but powerful and practical alternative approaches that are not tests in any sense. It is suggested that forecasters place less emphasis on p-values and more emphasis on the predictive ability of models.</description>

 Don&amp;rsquo;t set both width and height when using \includegraphics. It distorts the figure. Instead, I suggest using \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{..}
 Be consistent in capitalizing section and subsection headings, and titles in the bibliography. My preferences is to use sentence case throughout.

      <guid>https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/tracking-changes-in-latex-files/</guid>
      <description>When I write a paper, it usually goes through many versions before being submitted to a journal. I keep track of the different versions by renaming the file when I&amp;rsquo;m about to make major changes, or when I receive a new version from a coauthor. The files are named file1.tex, file2.tex, etc. where &amp;ldquo;file&amp;rdquo; is replaced by something more meaningful.
It is often useful to be able to compare versions to see what changes have been made, especially when working with coauthors.</description>

      <description>A common issue that arises with text files (e.g., R code) is to identify changes that have been made between versions. I usually number my R files as file1.R, file2.R, etc. (with &amp;ldquo;file&amp;rdquo; replaced by something more meaningful),with the number indicating the version of the file.

      <description>Last night I received the Vice-Chancellor&amp;rsquo;s postgraduate supervision award at a function at Government House. I am deeply honoured that my students thought to nominate me for the award. I think I was as surprised as anyone to win, and some people have asked me what I did to deserve it. Actually, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure that I did deserve it, but I can tell you what I told the award committee who chose me.</description>

      <description>I am frequently asked how I manage my time, and how I manage to get so much done. I don&amp;rsquo;t know that my approach is right for everyone, but in case it helps here are some comments on how I work.
One of the main traps that people fall into is to do things that are urgent, but not necessarily important. They react to the urgency of deadlines, and demands of colleagues, and end up spending a lot of time on things that don&amp;rsquo;t really matter much.</description>

      <title>Stochastic population forecasts using functional data models for mortality, fertility and migration</title>
      <link>https://robjhyndman.com/publications/stochastic-population-forecasts/</link>

      <guid>https://robjhyndman.com/publications/stochastic-population-forecasts/</guid>
      <description>Age-sex-specific population forecasts are derived through stochastic population renewal using forecasts of mortality, fertility and net migration. Functional data models with time series coefficients are used to model age-specific mortality and fertility rates. As detailed migration data are lacking, net migration by age and sex is estimated as the difference between historic annual population data and successive populations one year ahead derived from a projection using fertility and mortality data. This estimate, which includes error, is also modeled using a functional data model.</description>

      <title>Automatic time series forecasting: the forecast package for R</title>

      <guid>https://robjhyndman.com/publications/automatic-forecasting/</guid>
      <description>Automatic forecasts of large numbers of univariate time series are often needed in business and other contexts. We describe two automatic forecasting algorithms that have been implemented in the forecast package for R. The first is based on innovation state space models that underly exponential smoothing methods. The second is based on ARIMA models. The algorithms are applicable to both seasonal and non-seasonal data, and are compared and illustrated using four real time series.</description>

      <description>Australian Statistics Conference. Melbourne, July 2008.  Where: First International Workshop on Functional and Operatorial Statistics, Toulouse Where : Australian Statistical Conference Melbourne, Australia Speakers: Professor Rob&amp;nbsp;J&amp;nbsp;Hyndman, Monash University &amp;amp; Han Lin Shang, Monash University  Abstract: We propose some new tools for visualizing functional data and for identifying functional outliers. The proposed tools make use of robust principal component analysis, data depth and highest density regions. We compare the proposed outlier detection methods with the existing “functional depth” method, and show that our methods have better performance on identifying outliers in French male age-specific mortality data.</description>

      <guid>https://robjhyndman.com/publications/the-admissible-parameter-space-for-exponential-smoothing-models/</guid>
      <description>We discuss the admissible parameter space for some state space models, including the models that underly exponential smoothing methods. We find that the usual parameter restrictions (requiring all smoothing parameters to lie between 0 and 1) do not always lead to stable models. We also find that all seasonal exponential smoothing methods are unstable as the underlying state space models are neither reachable nor observable. This instability does not affect the forecasts, but does corrupt the state estimates.</description>

      <description>Where: International Symposium on Forecasting, Nice, France  Abstract: The most common forecasting methods in business are based on exponential smoothing and the most common time series in business are inherently non-negative. Therefore it is of interest to consider the properties of the potential stochastic models underlying exponential smoothing when applied to non-negative data. We explore nonlinear exponential smoothing state space models for non-negative data under various assumptions about the innovations, or error, process.</description>

      <description>I gave a one-day LaTeX workshop today.
Here is the blurb:
 LaTeX is an extremely powerful markup language for creating structured documents. It is particularly well-suited for documents containing mathematics, but can be used for any document. Those whose publications involve a large number of mathematical equations often use LaTeX rather than MS-Word or some other word processing package. It is the standard writing tool for most research in the mathematical sciences.</description>

 Notice that
  I agree with him that all of these are overused, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean they should be banned. The words &amp;ldquo;very&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;quite&amp;rdquo; are useful for conveying the strength of a statement.</description>

I find the library useful for keeping track of books that my students and colleagues borrow (I just add a tag containing their name to the book).</description>

      <description>There is a great article in today&amp;rsquo;s Australian by my co-author Peter Hall on the crisis in mathematics &amp;amp; statistics education (with student numbers falling at the same time as the number of jobs is rising).
The most interesting comment is the last paragraph:
 For a nation in the grip of a serious skills shortage in mathematics and statistics, another review is not needed. Action is needed. It should be possible to drive university behaviour in the national interest by foreshadowing that the Government&amp;rsquo;s proposed compacts will include a requirement that mathematics and statistics curriculums be offered in science and technology, education, business and economics courses across the country, taught by professionals in mathematics and statistics.</description>

      <description>A few years ago I did some forecasting work for a commonwealth government department and found that they were forecasting a $5 billion budget using the FORECAST command in Excel. Worse, they were fitting a regression through only three observations and they were not even the most recent observations.
It seems a similar thing has happened again. The Victorian government is projecting water consumption based on a regression through three observations.</description>

Instead, I decided to write a blog covering the same material, plus other things that might be of interest to my research team. Topics covered include LaTeX, R, writing and preparing a thesis, writing a journal article, submitting an article to a refereed journal, how to convince editors to publish your work, and writing referee reports. Topics of more specific interest to my research team include forecasting, data visualization and functional data, and local events such as meetups or statistics conferences.</description>

      <description>Where: Australian Frontiers of Science  Abstract: Functional time series are curves that are observed sequentially in time. For example, the curve of death rate as a function of age is observed annually. Yield curves in finance (essentially interest rates as a function of the term of investment) are observed each week or each day. Electricity consumption as a function of temperature is observed every month. These are all high dimensional functional data, indexed by time.</description>

      <description>In this paper, we model and forecast Australian domestic tourism demand. We use a regression framework to estimate important economic relationships for domestic tourism demand. We also identify the impact of world events such as the 2000 Sydney Olympics and the 2002 Bali bombings on Australian domestic tourism. To explore the time series nature of the data, we use innovation state space models to forecast the domestic tourism demand. Combining these two frameworks, we build innovation state space models with exogenous variables.</description>

      <description>We present tools to generate synthetic sequences of half-hourly temperatures with similar statistical characteristics to observed historical data. Temperatures are generated using a combination of daily and half-hourly temperature models which account for intra-day and intra-year seasonality, as well as short- and long-term serial correlations. Details of the model estimation are given as well as a description of the synthetic generation.
Keywords: temperature data, time series, Fourier series, ARMA models, seasonal block-bootstrap, synthetic generation.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m in the final stages of preparing my new exponential smoothing book for publication and have been learning about some LaTeX indexing tools.
The standard subject index is created using the following procedure:
 Include \index{entry} commands wherever you want an index entry.
 Include \usepackage{makeidx} and \makeindex in the preamble.
 Put a \printindex command where the index is to appear, normally before the \end{document} command.
  The details are well-documented in this tutorial (starting on p9).</description>

      <description>Many R users seem to get themselves in a bit of a mess with R files and workspaces scattered across different directories. The R files themselves also get messy and hard to follow. So here is some advice on keeping organized with R:
 Try to keep code strictly indented based on the code structure such as loops, if statements, etc. Every left brace { should be followed by an extra level of indentation which continues until the matching right brace }.</description>

      <description>Anyone who starts writing serious R code (i.e., code that involves user-written functions) soon finds the need to use debugging tools. There are a few basic tools in R that are worth knowing about.
The function debug() allows one to step through the execution of a function, line by line. At any point, you can print out values of variables or produce a graph of the results within the function. While debugging, you can simply type &amp;ldquo;c&amp;rdquo; to continue to the end of the current section of code (e.</description>

      <description>Abstract: Purpose To measure changes in drug utilization following a national general practice education program aimed at improving prescribing for hypertension.
Methods A series of nationally implemented, multifaceted educational interventions using social marketing principles focusing on prescribing for hypertension, was commenced in October 1999, and repeated in September 2001 and August 2003. The target group was all primary care prescribers in Australia and interventions were both active (voluntary) and passive. Newsletter and prescribing feedback was mailed in October 1999, September 2001 (newsletter only) and August 2003.</description>

      <title>Robust forecasting of mortality and fertility rates: a functional data approach</title>

      <guid>https://robjhyndman.com/publications/funcfor/</guid>
      <description>Abstract: A new method is proposed for forecasting age-specific mortality and fertility rates observed over time. This approach allows for smooth functions of age, is robust for outlying years due to wars and epidemics, and provides a modelling framework that is easily adapted to allow for constraints and other information. Ideas from functional data analysis, nonparametric smoothing and robust statistics are combined to form a methodology that is widely applicable to any functional time series data observed discretely and possibly with error.</description>

      <description>Background: The effects of environmental factors and ambient concentrations of grass pollen on allergic asthma are yet to be established.
Objective: We sought to estimate the independent effects of grass pollen concentrations in the air over Melbourne on asthma hospital admissions, for the 1992-1993 pollen season.
Methods: Daily grass pollen concentrations were monitored over a 24 hr period at three stations in Melbourne. The outcome variable was defined as all-age asthma hospital admissions with ICD9-493 codes.</description>

      <description>Where: International Symposium on Forecasting, New York  Abstract: Peak electricity demand forecasting is important in medium and long-term planning of electricity supply. Extreme demand often leads to supply failure with consequential business and social disruption. Forecasting extreme demand events is therefore an important problem in energy management.
Electricity demand at a given time is subject to a range of influences, including the ambient temperature, recent past temperatures, time of day, day of week, holidays, economic conditions and so on.</description>

      <guid>https://robjhyndman.com/publications/a-state-space-model-for-exponential-smoothing-with-group-seasonality/</guid>
      <description>We present an approach to improve forecast accuracy by simultaneously forecasting a group of products that exhibit similar seasonal demand patterns. Better seasonality estimates can be made by using information on all products in a group, and using these improved estimates when forecasting at the individual product level. This approach is called the group seasonal indices (GSI) approach, and is a generalization of the classical Holt-Winters procedure. This article describes an underlying state space model for this method and presents simulation results that show when it yields more accurate forecasts than Holt-Winters.</description>

      <description>The half-life is defined as the number of periods required for the impulse response to a unit shock to a time series to dissipate by half. It is widely used as a measure of persistence, especially in international economics to quantify the degree of mean-reversion of the deviation from an international parity condition. Several studies have proposed bias-corrected point and interval estimation methods. However, they have found that the confidence intervals are rather uninformative with their upper bound being either extremely large or infinite.</description>

      <description>How much data do you need to forecast using a seasonal model? The answer depends on the type of model being used and the amount of random variation in the data. We discuss the mathematical limits for estimating various common seasonal forecasting models from data. These limits apply when the amount of random variation is very small. Real data often contain a lot of random variation, and then many more observations are required.</description>

      <description>Accurate estimates of future age-specific incidence and mortality are critical for allocation of resources to breast cancer control programs and evaluation of screening programs. The purpose of this study is to apply functional data analysis techniques to model age-specific breast cancer mortality time trends, and forecast entire age-specific mortality functions using a state-space approach. We use annual unadjusted breast cancer mortality rates in Australia, from 1921 to 2001 in five year age groups (45 to 85+).</description>

      <description>We discuss and compare measures of accuracy of univariate time series forecasts. The methods used in the M-competition and the M3-competition, and many of the measures recommended by previous authors on this topic, are found to be degenerate in commonly occurring situations. Instead, we propose that the mean absolute scaled error become the standard measure for comparing forecast accuracy across multiple time series.

Then there was a time when forecasters could be charged with vagrancy! Their reputations are still tarnished, but their tools are rather more effective. Professor Rob Hyndman will argue for the importance of statistical modelling in forecasting, and demonstrate the dangers that occur when uncertainty is ignored.</description>

      <description>We compare the short- to medium- term accuracy of five variants or extensions of the Lee-Carter method for mortality forecasting. These include the original Lee-Carter, the Lee-Miller and Booth-Maindonald-Smith variants, and the more flexible Hyndman-Ullah and De Jong-Tickle extensions. These methods are compared by applying them to sex-specific populations of 10 developed countries using data for 1986-2000 for evaluation. All variants and extensions are more accurate than the original Lee-Carter method for forecasting log death rates, by up to 61%.</description>

      <description>Some of the proposed measures of forecast accuracy for intermittent demand can give infinite or undefined values. This makes them unsuitable for general use. I summarize the various measures and demonstrate what can go wrong. Then I describe a new measure (the mean absolute scaled error) which does not have these flaws. I believe it should become the standard measure for comparing forecast accuracy for multiple intermittent-demand series.
Errata: In the series shown in Table 2, the sixth value should be 11 (not 1).</description>

      <description>Kernel density estimation for multivariate data is an important technique that has a wide range of applications. However, it has received significantly less attention than its univariate counterpart. The lower level of interest in multivariate kernel density estimation is mainly due to the increased difficulty in deriving an optimal data-driven bandwidth as the dimension of the data increases. We provide Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms for estimating optimal bandwidth matrices for multivariate kernel density estimation.</description>

      <description>With the growing importance of time series clustering research, particularly for similarity searches amongst long time series such as those arising in medicine or finance, it is critical for us to find a way to resolve the outstanding problems that make most clustering methods impractical under certain circumstances. When the time series is very long, some clustering algorithms may fail because the very notation of similarity is dubious in high dimension space; many methods cannot handle missing data when the clustering is based on a distance metric.</description>

      <description>We present a local linear estimator with variable bandwidth for multivariate nonparametric regression. We prove its consistency and asymptotic normality in the interior of the observed data and obtain its rates of convergence. This result is used to obtain practical direct plug-in bandwidth selectors for heteroscedastic regression in one and two dimensions. We show that the local linear estimator with variable bandwidth has better goodness-of-fit properties than the local linear estimator with constant bandwidth, in the presence of heteroscedasticity.</description>

      <description>This paper investigates the effect of aggregation in relation to the accuracy of television network rating forecasts. We compare the forecast accuracy of network ratings using population rating models, rating models for demographic/behavioural segments and individual viewing behaviour models. Models are fitted using neural networks, decision trees and regression. The most accurate forecasts are obtained by aggregating forecasts from segment rating models, with neural networks being used to fit these models.</description>

      <description>In this paper, we propose a new Empirical Information Criterion (EIC) for model selection which penalizes the likelihood of the data by a function of the number of parameters in the model. It is designed to be used where there are a large number of time series to be forecast. However, a bootstrap version of the EIC can be used where there is a single time series to be forecast. The EIC provides a data-driven model selection tool that can be tuned to the particular forecasting task.</description>

      <description>Intermittent demand commonly occurs with inventory data, with many time periods having no demand and small demand in the other periods. Croston&amp;rsquo;s method is a widely used procedure for intermittent demand forecasting. However, it is an ad~hoc method with no properly formulated underlying stochastic model. In this paper, we explore possible models underlying Croston&amp;rsquo;s method and three related methods, and we show that any underlying model will be inconsistent with the properties of intermittent demand data.</description>

      <title>Dimension reduction for clustering time series using global characteristics</title>
      <link>https://robjhyndman.com/publications/dimension-reduction-for-clustering-time-series-using-global-characteristics/</link>

      <description>Existing methods for time series clustering rely on the actual data values can become impractical since the methods do not easily handle dataset with high dimensionality, missing value, or different lengths. In this paper, a dimension reduction method is proposed that replaces the raw data with some global measures of time series characteristics. These measures are then clustered using a self-organizing map. The proposed approach has been tested using benchmark time series previously reported for time series clustering, and is shown to yield useful and robust clustering.</description>

      <title>Robust forecasting of mortality and fertility rates: a functional data approach</title>

      <guid>https://robjhyndman.com/publications/robust-forecasting-of-mortality-and-fertility-rates-a-functional-data-approach/</guid>
      <description>We propose a new method for forecasting age-specific mortality and fertility rates observed over time. We combine ideas from functional data analysis, nonparametric smoothing and robust statistics to form a methodology that is widely applicable to any functional time series data, and age-specific mortality and fertility in particular. Our approach provides a modelling framework that is easily adapted to allow for constraints and other information. The model used can be considered a generalization of the Lee-Carter model commonly used in mortality and fertility forecasting.</description>

      <title>Time series forecasting: the case for the single source of error state space approach</title>
      <link>https://robjhyndman.com/publications/322/</link>

      <description>The state space approach to modelling univariate time series is now widely used both in theory and in applications. However, the very richness of the framework means that quite different model formulations are possible, even when they purport to describe the same phenomena. In this paper, we examine the single source of error [SSOE] scheme, which has perfectly correlated error components. We then proceed to compare SSOE to the more common version of the state space models, for which all the error terms are independent; we refer to this as the multiple source of error [MSOE] scheme.</description>

      <guid>https://robjhyndman.com/publications/prediction-intervals-for-exponential-smoothing-using-two-new-classes-of-state-space-models/</guid>
      <description>Three general classes of state space models are presented, based upon the single source of error formulation. The first class is the standard linear state space model with homoscedastic errors, the second retains the linear structure but incorporates a dynamic form of heteroscedasticity, and the third allows for non-linear structure in the observation equation as well as heteroscedasticity. These three classes provide stochastic models for a wide variety of exponential smoothing methods.</description>

      <title>Local linear forecasts using cubic smoothing splines</title>

      <description>We show how cubic smoothing splines fitted to univariate time series data can be used to obtain local linear forecasts. Our approach is based on a stochastic state space model which allows the use of a likelihood approach for estimating the smoothing parameter, and which enables easy construction of prediction intervals. We show that our model is a special case of an ARIMA(0,2,2) model and we provide a simple upper bound for the smoothing parameter to ensure an invertible model.</description>

      <guid>https://robjhyndman.com/publications/nonparametric-confidence-intervals-for-receiver-operating-characteristic-curves/</guid>
      <description>We study methods for constructing confidence intervals, and confidence bands, for estimators of receiver operating characteristics. Particular emphasis is placed on the way in which smoothing should be implemented, when estimating either the characteristic itself or its variance. We show that substantial undersmoothing is necessary if coverage properties are not to be impaired. A theoretical analysis of the problem suggests an empirical, plug-in rule for bandwidth choice, optimising the coverage accuracy of interval estimators.</description>

      <description>Exponential smoothing is often used to forecast lead-time demand for inventory control. In this paper, formulae are provided for calculating means and variances of lead-time demand for a wide variety of exponential smoothing methods. A feature of many of the formulae is that variances, as well as the means, depend on trends and seasonal effects. Thus, these formulae provide the opportunity to implement methods that ensure that safety stocks adjust to changes in trend or changes in season.</description>

      <description>In demography, it is often necessary to obtain a monotonic interpolation of data. A solution to this problem is available using the Hyman filter for cubic splines. However, this does not seem to be well-known amongst demographers, and no implementation of the procedure is readily available. We remedy these problems by outlining the relevant ideas here, and providing a function for the R package.

      <description>The &amp;ldquo;Theta method&amp;rdquo; of forecasting performed particularly well in the M3-competition and is therefore of interest to forecast practitioners. The description of the method given by Assimakopoulos and Nikolopoulos (2000) involves several pages of algebraic manipulation and is difficult to comprehend. We show that the method can be expressed much more simply; furthermore we show that the forecasts obtained are equivalent to simple exponential smoothing with drift.

      <description>The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve is used to describe the performance of a diagnostic test which classifies observations into two groups. We introduce new methods for selecting bandwidths when computing kernel estimates of ROC curves. Our techniques allow for interaction between the distributions of each group of observations and gives substantial improvement in MISE over other proposed methods, especially when the two distributions are very different.

      <description>We propose a new method for estimation of the hazard function from a set of censored failure time data, with a view to extending the general approach to more complicated models. The approach is based on a mixed model representation of penalized spline hazard estimators. One payoff is the automation of the smoothing parameter choice through restricted maximum likelihood. Another is the option to use standard mixed model software for automatic hazard estimation.</description>

      <description>We suggest two new methods for conditional density estimation. The first is based on locally fitting a log-linear model, and is in the spirit of recent work on locally parametric techniques in density estimation. The second method is a constrained local polynomial estimator. Both methods always produce non-negative estimators. We propose an algorithm suitable for selecting the two bandwidths for either estimator. We also develop a new bootstrap test for the symmetry of conditional density functions.</description>

      <description>R, an open-source programming environment for data analysis and graphics, has in only a decade grown to become a de-facto standard for statistical analysis against which many popular commercial programs may be measured. The use of R for the teaching of econometric methods is appealing. It provides cutting-edge statistical methods which are, by R&amp;rsquo;s open-source nature, available immediately. The software is stable, available at no cost, and exists for a number of platforms, including various flavors of Unix and Linux, Windows (9x/NT/2000), and the MacOS.</description>

      <description>Lemming populations are generally characterised by their cyclic nature, yet empirical data to support this are lacking for most species, largely because of the time and expense necessary to collect long-term population data. In this study we use the relative frequency of yearly willow scarring by lemmings as an index of lemming abundance, allowing us to plot population changes over a 34-year period. Scars were collected from 18 sites in Arctic North America separated by 2-1,647 km to investigate local synchrony among separate populations.</description>

      <description>Data visualization has become an integral part of statistical modelling. Exploratory graphical analysis allows insight into the underlying structure of observations in a data set, and graphical methods for diagnostic purposes after model fitting provide insight into the fitted model and its inadequacies. In this paper we present visualization methods for preliminary exploration of time series data and graphical diagnostic methods for modelling relationships between time series data in medicine. We will use exploratory graphical methods to better understand the relationship between a time series response and a number of potential covariates.</description>

      <description>We consider bandwidth selection for the kernel estimator of conditional density with one explanatory variable. Several bandwidth selection methods are derived ranging from fast rules-of-thumb which assume the underlying densities are known to relatively slow procedures which use the bootstrap. The methods are compared and a practical bandwidth selection strategy which combines the methods is proposed. The methods are compared using two simulation studies and a real data set.

      <description>We give a general formulation of a non-Gaussian conditional linear AR(1) model subsuming most of the non-Gaussian AR(1) models that have appeared in the literature. We derive some general results giving properties for the stationary process mean, variance and correlation structure, and conditions for stationarity. These results highlight similarities and differences with the Gaussian AR(1) model, and unify many separate results appearing in the literature. Examples illustrate the wide range of properties that can appear under the conditional linear autoregressive assumption.</description>

      <description>This paper considers residuals for time series regression. Despite much literature on visual diagnostics for uncorrelated data, there is little on the autocorrelated case. In order to examine various aspects of the fitted time series regression model, three residuals are considered. The fitted regression model can be checked using orthogonal residuals; the time series error model can be analysed using marginal residuals; and the white noise error component can be tested using conditional residuals.</description>

      <description>We study the relationship between daily hospital admissions for respiratory disease and various pollutant and climatic variables, looking particularly at the effect of seasonal adjustment on the estimated models. Often time series exhibit seasonal behaviour and adequate control for the presence of a seasonal component is essential before one attempts to model the complex pollution-health association. We show that if these factors are not adequately controlled for, spurious effects of pollutants and climate on morbidity/mortality can be induced.</description>

      <description>We consider modelling time series using a generalized additive model with first-order Markov structure and mixed transition density having a discrete component at zero and a continuous component with positive sample space. Such models have application, for example, in modelling daily occurrence and intensity of rainfall, and in modelling the number and size of insurance claims. We show how these methods extend the usual sinusoidal seasonal assumption in standard chain-dependent models by assuming a general smooth pattern of occurrence and intensity over time.</description>

      <description>I consider models for binary time series, starting with autoregression models and then developing generalizations of them which allow nonparametric additive covariates. I show that several apparently different binary AR(1) models are equivalent. Three possible nonparametric additive regression models which allow for autocorrelation are considered; one is a generalization of an ARX model, the other two are generalizations of a regression model with AR errors. One of the models is applied to two data sets: IBM stock transactions and Melbourne&amp;rsquo;s rainfall.</description>

      <description>We consider nonparametric smoothing for time series which are clearly non-Gaussian and which are subject to an autoregressive random component. This generalizes methods for smoothing Gaussian series with autoregressive errors, but in the non-Gaussian case the autoregressive structure is not always additive. The problem can be formulated in a general way to include many common non-Gaussian autoregressive models. The amount of smoothing can be chosen by penalized likelihood methods, and we give simulations and parametric bootstrap methods for studying and empirically estimating the penalty function.</description>

      <guid>https://robjhyndman.com/publications/nonparametric-autocovariance-function-estimation/</guid>
      <description>Nonparametric estimators of autocovariance functions for non-stationary time series are developed. The estimators are based on straightforward nonparametric mean function estimation ideas and allow use of any linear smoother (e.g. smoothing spline, local polynomial). We study the properties of the estimators and illustrate their usefulness through application to some meteorological and seismic time series.
Keywords: bandwidth; correlated errors; kernel smoothing; local polynomial; nonparametric regression; non-stationary model; time series.

      <description>We study the most basic Bayesian forecasting model for exponential family time series, the power steady model (PSM) of Smith, in terms of observable properties of one-step forecast distributions and sample paths. The PSM implies a constraint between location and spread of the forecast distribution. Including a scale parameter in the models does not always give an exact solution free of this problem, but it does suggest how to define related models free of the constraint.</description>

      <description>(Later known as Journal of Computational Intelligence in Finance)
The residuals between conventional option pricing models and market prices have persistent patterns or biases. The &amp;ldquo;hybrid&amp;rdquo; method models the residuals using an artificial neural network. The pricing accuracy of the hybrid method is demonstrated on real data using the Australian All Ordinaries Share Price Index options on futures and is compared with all major competing conventional models. The hybrid method is found to be both statistically and economically superior to the conventional models alone.</description>

      <description>There are a large number of different definitions used for sample quantiles in statistical computer packages. Often within the same package one definition will be used to compute a quantile explicitly while other definitions may be used when producing a boxplot, a probability plot or a QQ-plot. We compare the most commonly implemented sample quantile definitions by writing them in a common notation and investigating their motivation and some of their properties.</description>

      <guid>https://robjhyndman.com/publications/estimating-and-visualizing-conditional-densities/</guid>
      <description>We consider the kernel estimator of conditional density and derive its asymptotic bias, variance and mean-square error. Optimal bandwidths (with respect to integrated mean-square error) are found and it is shown that the convergence rate of the density estimator is order n-2&amp;frasl;3. We also note that the conditional mean function obtained from the estimator is equivalent to a kernel smoother. Given the undesirable bias properties of kernel smoothers, we seek a modified conditional density estimator which has mean equivalent to some other nonparametric regression smoother with better bias properties.</description>

      <guid>https://robjhyndman.com/publications/computing-and-graphing-highest-density-regions/</guid>
      <description>Many statistical methods involve summarizing a probability distribution by a region of the sample space covering a specified probability. One method of selecting such a region is to require it to contain points of relatively high density. Highest density regions are particularly useful for displaying multimodal distributions and, in such cases, may consist of several disjoint subsets &amp;mdash; one for each local mode. In this paper, I propose a simple method for computing a highest density region from any given (possibly multivariate) density f(x) which is bounded and continuous in x.</description>

      <description>We review and synthesize the wide range of non-Gaussian first order linear autoregressive models that have appeared in the literature. Models are organized into broad classes to clarify similarities and differences and facilitate application in particular situations. General properties for process mean, variance and correlation are derived, unifying many separate results appearing in the literature. Examples illustrate the wide range of properties that can appear even under the autoregressive assumption. These results are used in analysing a variety of real data sets, illustrating general methods of estimation, model diagnostics and model selection.</description>

      <description>Many modern time series methods, such as those involving non-linear models or non-normal data, frequently lead to forecast densities which are asymmetric or multi-modal. The problem of obtaining forecast regions in such cases is discussed and it is proposed that highest density forecast regions be used. A graphical method for presenting the results is discussed.
Keywords: non-linear time series, non-normal time series, highest density regions, forecast intervals, threshold models.

      <description>Most statistical packages use Sturges&amp;rsquo; rule (or an extension of it) for selecting the number of classes when constructing a histogram. Sturges&amp;rsquo; rule is also widely recommended in introductory statistics textbooks. It is known that Sturges&amp;rsquo; rule leads to oversmoothed histograms, but Sturges&amp;rsquo; derivation of his rule has never been questioned. In this note, I point out that the argument leading to Sturges&amp;rsquo; rule is wrong.</description>

      <description>Continuous time threshold autoregressive (CTAR) processes have been developed in the past few years for modelling non-linear time series observed at irregular intervals. Several approximating processes are given here which are useful for simulation and inference. Each of the approximating processes implicitly defines conditions on the thresholds, thus providing greater understanding of the way in which boundary conditions arise.
Keywords: continuous time autoregression, threshold autoregression, non-linear stochastic differential equations, unequally spaced time series.</description>

      <description>I consider continuous time autoregressive (CAR) processes of order p and develop estimators of the model parameters based on Yule&amp;ndash;Walker type equations. For continuously recorded data, it is shown that these estimators are least squares estimators and have the same asymptotic distribution as maximum likelihood estimators. In practice, though, data can only be observed discretely. For discrete data, I consider approximations to the continuous time estimators. It is shown that some of these discrete time estimators are asymptotically biased.</description>

      <description>The use of non-linear models in time series analysis has expanded rapidly in the last ten years, with the development of several useful classes of discrete-time non-linear models. One family of processes which has been found valuable is the class of self-exciting threshold autoregressive (SETAR) models discussed extensively in the books of Tong (1983, 1990). In this paper we consider problems of modelling and forecasting with continuous-time threshold autoregressive (CTAR) processes.</description>

      <description>The importance of non-linear models in time series analysis has been recognized increasingly over the past ten years. A number of discrete time non-linear processes have been introduced and found valuable for the modelling of observed series. Among these processes are the discrete time threshold models, discussed extensively in the book of Tong (1983). The purpose of this paper is to define a continuous time analogue of the threshold AR(p) process and to discuss some of its properties.</description>

      <description>ETC3550: Applied Forecasting for Business and Economics Reliable forecasts of business and economic variables must often be obtained against a backdrop of structural change in markets and the economy. This unit introduces methods suitable for forecasting in these circumstances including the decomposition of time series, exponential smoothing methods, ARIMA modelling, and regression with auto-correlated disturbances. Students can expect to enhance their computer skills with exercises using R.
