<h2 id="using-manuscriptcentral">Using ManuscriptCentral</h2>

<p>When you log into <a href="https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/ijf">https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/ijf</a> you will see an &ldquo;Associate Editor Center&rdquo; and a &ldquo;Handling Editor Center&rdquo;, along with your &ldquo;Reviewer Center&rdquo; and &ldquo;Author Center&rdquo;. These are for different roles that you have with the journal. You will mostly be using the &ldquo;Handling Editor Center&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Please log in every week to check on papers you are handling and to handle any new papers you have been allocated. You will receive email notifications about new papers, but you won&rsquo;t necessarily receive any notifications about papers where the associate editors are overdue. So you need to keep on top of this and chase the associate editors where necessary.</p>

<p>Please resist the temptation to email associate editors or reviewers outside the manuscriptcentral system. It is much easier overall if all correspondence about a paper is handled via the site. That way, we can track everything and no paper will fall through the cracks. You can usually email someone about a paper by clicking on their name when viewing the paper details.</p>

<h2 id="new-submissions">New submissions</h2>

<p>All new submissions come to me and my editorial assistant checks that they satisfy some basic criteria (they must be about forecasting, they must be blinded, etc.) Then I usually have a look at the papers that pass the first check. I reject some of these without bothering the other editors. Any papers that are not obviously rubbish get allocated to one of the editors. Once a paper is allocated to you, you are solely responsible after that until the paper is either accepted or rejected. If you accept a paper for publication, then I take responsibility for getting the proof organized, and allocating the paper to an issue.</p>

<p>Just desk-reject anything that deserves it. Just because I&rsquo;ve sent it to you does not mean I think it is any good, or even that I have read it properly. Only send papers to associate editors if you think the paper deserves a more careful reading.</p>

<p>Desk rejections are very common, and are encouraged where possible. I like to protect people further down the chain from having to handle bad papers. So I will desk reject the really bad stuff (there&rsquo;s plenty of that) and send the rest on to one of the Editors (which includes myself). Each Editor is encouraged to desk reject anything that isn&rsquo;t worth bothering an AE with. And each AE is encouraged to desk reject anything that isn&rsquo;t worth bothering reviewers with. The only papers that reviewers should see are those that an Editor and an AE both think is worth a more thorough read by someone. This system both protects our reviewers (so that they are more available when we really need them) and it is good for authors &ndash; better a quick rejection than a painfully slow one.</p>

<p>To desk reject a paper, click on the &ldquo;Manuscript Information&rdquo; tab and scroll down to the section headed &ldquo;HE Decision&rdquo;. When you click &ldquo;Reject&rdquo; and then &ldquo;Commit Decision&rdquo;, an email template will be generated and you can modify it as appropriate. Similarly for any other decision.</p>

<p>Desk rejection letters do not normally contain reviews &ndash; just a few sentences explaining why we are not going to consider the paper further is sufficient.</p>

<h2 id="choosing-an-ae">Choosing an AE</h2>

<p>If you think the paper is worth sending to an AE, try to choose someone who has expertise close to the topic of the paper. The list of associate editors is at <a href="http://goo.gl/ZGLp68">http://goo.gl/ZGLp68</a> along with the topics they are most comfortable in handling. If you are unsure, please check that list first.</p>

<p>There are a few people on the Manuscript Central &ldquo;AE list&rdquo; who are not really AEs. These are guest editors of special issues and you shouldn&rsquo;t send them any papers. If you aren&rsquo;t sure, just check the list at the link above.</p>

<p>Also, you shouldn&rsquo;t select one of the other five editors as an AE, even though they appear on the list.</p>

<p>When you select an AE, first select their name from the list. The figure in parentheses beside their name is the number of papers they are currently handling. Please don&rsquo;t select someone who is already handling 3 or more papers. Also, click on &ldquo;View Details&rdquo; beside their name to see how many papers they have handled in the past 12 months. Please don&rsquo;t select the person if it is 10 or more. We need to spread the load as much as possible.</p>

<p>You can select yourself as an AE if you want to. Then you become responsible for finding reviewers for the paper as well. I only do that when (a) the paper is close to my own research interests; and (b) I can&rsquo;t find a suitable AE who is available.</p>

<p>If you are having trouble finding an AE for some topics, then please raise it with me. We may need to find a new AE in that area.</p>

<p>Once you&rsquo;ve sent a paper to an AE, you can generally relax until they send back a report. However, you might need to check up on them from time to time to make sure the paper is being processed. In particular, check after about a month to ensure they have got some reviewers organized. Check again after 3 months if they have not yet provided a report and recommendation. You can see all this on the system without actually emailing them. In general, we aim to get a first response back to the author inside 3 months.</p>

<h2 id="making-a-decision">Making a decision</h2>

<p>AEs will provide a recommendation along with one or two reviewer reports. Sometimes they will just write a report themselves along with a reject recommendation. If they have sent it to reviewers, there should be two reports along with a recommendation. Normally you would follow the reviewer recommendation, but you do not have to. The editor makes the decision, not the AE and not the reviewers (and not me).</p>

<p>There are five decision categories:
 * accept: that means no further revisions are possible. Only choose this when you are completely satisfied with the paper.
 * minor revision: this is for papers where some small changes are required, which should only take the authors a few weeks at most. You would not normally send a paper back to the reviewers for the next version after a minor revision decision (although it might go back to the AE).
 * major revision: this is for papers which will go back to the same reviewers for another look.
 * reject and resubmit: the next version of the paper will be handled as a new submission and will not necessarily go back to the same reviewers (although it would be best to go to the same AE if possible). This is for papers where the revisions are too substantial for a &ldquo;major revision&rdquo; decision, but you think there is enough merit in the paper not to reject it.
 * reject: the paper is rejected, and no revision of it is allowed to be submitted to the IJF.</p>

<p>Our impact factor has been around 1.6 for the last few years. That is, each paper is cited an average of about 1.6 times in the first two years after publication. If you think a paper is unlikely to receive at least one or two citations in the first couple of years, then it is probably not of sufficient quality for the IJF.</p>

<p>We publish about 80 papers per year, and receive about 500 submissions per year. So the acceptance rate is about 16%. If in doubt, reject.</p>

<h2 id="things-to-look-for-in-papers-you-are-accepting">Things to look for in papers you are accepting</h2>

<ul>
<li>Make sure the figures are of good quality (high enough resolution to be reproduced in the journal), axes labelled, etc. Color figures are ok. At proof stage, we insert a comment in the caption saying &ldquo;See the online version of this paper for the color figures&rdquo; or something like that.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t worry about minor English problems as they are fixed by my copyeditor. However, if the English is very bad, please ask them to seek the help of an English editor before accepting the paper. Elsevier provide such a service (for a fee): <a href="http://webshop.elsevier.com/languageservices/languageediting/">http://webshop.elsevier.com/languageservices/languageediting/</a></li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t worry about formatting, bibliography style, etc. My copyeditor will fix this up.</li>
<li>We can have online supplements to papers that are attached to the paper on sciencedirect. So if the paper is too long, or has too many tables, figures, etc., please suggest this option to the author. The online supplements can be submitted with the paper as supplementary files.</li>
<li>We do not have a maximum or minimum number of pages per paper, but try to keep papers as short as possible given the number of ideas they contain. I don&rsquo;t mind very short research notes (e.g., 2 pages) provided they say something useful and you think they are likely to be cited.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="problems">Problems</h2>

<p>There is no need to cc me on anything as I can see all your activity within manuscript central, although I almost never look unless some author contacts me asking what is happening with their paper. Once I allocate a paper to you, I generally don&rsquo;t think about it again unless you or the author brings it to my attention.</p>

<p>One issue that sometimes arises is that a revision is late. Authors are given a certain amount of time to submit revisions (less time for minor revisions, more time for resubmissions). Once the deadline is passed, it is not possible for them to submit the paper as a revision or resubmission. Sometimes they ask for an extension. We almost always grant such extensions, but only I can do that on the system. So just send me an email with the paper ID and the new deadline you want to impose.</p>

<p>If you have any problems with manuscript central, or any questions about the process, or about how to handle a particular paper, please don&rsquo;t hesitate to ask.</p>
