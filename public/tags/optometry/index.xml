      <description>Purpose: The purpose of this study was to produce normative data for Rosner&amp;rsquo;s Test of Visual Analysis Skills (TVAS). Methods: 886 unselected children aged 5 to 10 years and in the first 4 years of school in Australia were tested to threshold on the TVAS. Percentiles, means and standard deviations for each age group were calculated. Results: We found a steady increase in scores with grade and age and a significant difference in scores between each of the ages and grades.</description>
