      <title>Optimal forecast reconciliation for hierarchical and grouped time series through trace minimization</title>

      <description>Large collections of time series often have aggregation constraints due to product or geographical groupings. The forecasts for the most disaggregated series are usually required to add-up exactly to the forecasts of the aggregated series, a constraint we refer to as &amp;ldquo;coherence&amp;rdquo;. Forecast reconciliation is the process of adjusting forecasts to make them coherent. The reconciliation algorithm proposed by Hyndman et al. (2011) is based on a generalized least squares estimator that requires an estimate of the covariance matrix of the coherency errors (i.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Algorithm Selection for Pareto Optimal Set Approximation</title>
      <link>https://robjhyndman.com/publications/dynamic-pareto-approximation/</link>

      <description>This paper presents a meta-algorithm for approximating the Pareto optimal set of costly black-box multiobjective optimization problems given a limited number of objective function evaluations. The key idea is to switch among different algorithms during the optimization search based on the predicted performance of each algorithm at the time. Algorithm performance is modeled using a machine learning technique based on the available information. The predicted best algorithm is then selected to run for a limited number of evaluations.</description>

      <title>On sampling methods for costly multi-objective black-box optimization</title>
      <link>https://robjhyndman.com/publications/sampling-multiobjective-optimization/</link>

      <description>We investigate the impact of different sampling techniques on the performance of multi-objective optimization methods applied to costly black-box optimization problems. Such problems are often solved using an algorithm in which a surrogate model approximates the true objective function and provides predicted objective values at a lower cost. As the surrogate model is based on evaluations of a small number of points, the quality of the initial sample can have a great effect on the overall effectiveness of the optimization.</description>

      <title>STR: A Seasonal-Trend Decomposition Procedure Based on Regression</title>
      <link>https://robjhyndman.com/publications/str/</link>

      <description>We propose new generic methods for decomposing seasonal data: STR (a Seasonal-Trend decomposition procedure based on Regression) and Robust STR. In some ways, STR is similar to Ridge Regression and Robust STR can be related to LASSO. Our new methods are much more general than any alternative time series decomposition methods. They allow for multiple seasonal and cyclic components, and multiple linear regressors with constant, flexible, seasonal and cyclic influence. Seasonal patterns (for both seasonal components and seasonal regressors) can be fractional and flexible over time; moreover they can be either strictly periodic or have a more complex topology.</description>

      <title>Efficient identification of the Pareto optimal set</title>

      <description>In this paper, we focus on expensive multiobjective optimization problems and propose a method to predict an approximation of the Pareto optimal set using classification of sampled decision vectors as dominated or nondominated. The performance of our method, called EPIC, is demonstrated on a set of benchmark problems used in the multiobjective optimization literature and compared with state-of-the-art methods, ParEGO and PAL. The initial results are promising and encourage further research in this direction.</description>

      <title>Low-dimensional decomposition, smoothing and forecasting of sparse functional data</title>
      <link>https://robjhyndman.com/publications/ropes/</link>

      <description>We propose a new generic method ROPES (Regularized Optimization for Prediction and Estimation with Sparse data) for decomposing, smoothing and forecasting two-dimensional sparse data. In some ways, ROPES is similar to Ridge Regression, the LASSO, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Maximum-Margin Matrix Factorisation (MMMF). Using this new approach, we propose a practical method of forecasting mortality rates, as well as a new method for interpolating and extrapolating sparse longitudinal data. We also show how to calculate prediction intervals for the resulting estimates.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric and semiparametric response surface methodology: a review of designs, models and optimization techniques</title>

      <description>Abstract: Since the introduction of Response Surface Methodology in the 1950s, there have been many developments with the aim of expanding the range of applications of the methodology. Various new design, modeling and optimization techniques have been introduced for coping with unknown input-output relationships, costly or time-consuming experimental studies and irregular experimental regions (e.g., non-cubic or non-spherical regions induced by constraints in the input variables). Such developments may involve many different research areas simultaneously (e.</description>

      <title>Method for optimizing coating properties based on an evolutionary algorithm approach</title>

      <description>In industry as well as many areas of scientific research, data collected often contain a number of responses of interest for a chosen set of exploratory variables. Optimization of such multivariable multiresponse systems is a challenge well suited to genetic algorithms as global optimization tools. One such example is the optimization of coating surfaces with the required absolute and relative sensitivity for detecting analytes using devices such as sensor arrays. High-throughput synthesis and screening methods can be used to accelerate materials discovery and optimization; however, an important practical consideration for successful optimization of materials for arrays and other applications is the ability to generate adequate information from a minimum number of experiments.</description>

      <description>An evolutionary approach for the optimization of microarray coatings produced via sol-gel chemistry is presented. The aim of the methodology is to face the challenging aspects of the problem: high dimensional variable space, constraints on the independent variables, multiple responses, expensive or time-consuming experimental trials, expected complexity of the functional relationships between independent and response variables. The proposed approach iteratively select a set of experiments by combining a multiobjective Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and a multiresponse Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spines (MARS) model.</description>
