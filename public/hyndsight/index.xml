      <description>In late June, I will be in New York to teach my 3-day workshop on Forecasting using R. Tickets are available at Eventbrite.
This is the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve taught this workshop in the US, having previously run it in the Netherlands and Australia. It will be based on the 2nd edition of my book &amp;ldquo;Forecasting: Principles and Practice&amp;rdquo; with George Athanasopoulos. All participants will get a print version of the book.</description>

      <description>The latest version of the forecast package for R is now on CRAN. This is the version used in the 2nd edition of my forecasting textbook with George Athanasopoulos. So readers should now be able to replicate all examples in the book using only CRAN packages.
A few new features of the forecast package may be of interest. A more complete Changelog is also available.
mstl() handles multiple seasonality STL decomposition was designed to handle a single type of seasonality, but modern data often involves several seasonal periods (e.</description>

      <title>A brief history of time series forecasting competitions</title>
      <link>https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/forecasting-competitions/</link>

      <description>Prediction competitions are now so widespread that it is often forgotten how controversial they were when first held, and how influential they have been over the years.
To keep this exercise manageable, I will restrict attention to time series forecasting competitions &amp;mdash; where only the history of the data is available when producing forecasts.
Nottingham studies The earliest non-trivial study of time series forecast accuracy was probably by David Reid as part of his PhD at the University of Nottingham (1969).</description>

      <description>The M4 forecasting competition is well under-way, and a few of my PhD students have been working on submissions.
Pablo Montero-Manso, Carla Netto, and Thiyanga Talagala have made an R package containing all of the data (100,000 time series), which should make it substantially easier for other contestants to load the data into R in order to compute forecasts.
Grab the package from this github repository.

      <description>The official guidelines for the M4 competition have now been published, and there have been several developments since my last post on this.
 There is now a prize for prediction interval accuracy using a scaled version of the Mean Interval Score. If the $100(1-\alpha)$% prediction interval for time $t$ is given by $[L_{t},U_{t}]$, for $t=1,\dots,h$, then the MIS is defined as $$\frac{1}{h}\sum_{t=1}^{h} \left[ (U_t-L_t) + \frac{2}{\alpha}(L_t-Y_t)1(Y_t &amp;lt; L_t) + \frac{2}{\alpha}(Y_t-U_t)1(Y_t &amp;gt; U_t) \right] $$ where $Y_t$ is the observation at time $t$.</description>

      <description>For the last few years, I have been involved with running a 3-day short course on &amp;ldquo;Data Science for Managers&amp;rdquo;. We have run it twice each year since 2015, and it continues to prove very popular. We have some awesome presenters including Monash University professors Di Cook, Geoff Webb, and Kim Marriott, as well as several very experienced data scientists working in industry.
The next course will be held on 8-10 May 2018.</description>

      <guid>https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/tspackages/</guid>
      <description>This week I have finished preliminary versions of two new R packages for time series analysis. The first (tscompdata) contains several large collections of time series that have been used in forecasting competitions; the second (tsfeatures) is designed to compute features from univariate time series data. For now, both are only on github. I will probably submit them to CRAN after they’ve been tested by a few more people.
tscompdata There are already two packages containing forecasting competition data: Mcomp (containing the M and M3 competition data) and Tcomp (containing the tourism competition data).</description>

      <description>Following my post on the M4 competition yesterday, Spyros Makridakis sent me these comments for posting here.
I would like to thank Rob, my friend and co-author, for his insightful remarks concerning the upcoming M4 competition. As Rob says, the two of us have talked a great deal about competitions and I certainly agree with him about the “ideal” forecasting competition. In this reply, I will explain why I have deviated from the “ideal”, mostly for practical reasons and to ensure higher participation.</description>

      <description>The &amp;ldquo;M&amp;rdquo; competitions organized by Spyros Makridakis have had an enormous influence on the field of forecasting. They focused attention on what models produced good forecasts, rather than on the mathematical properties of those models. For that, Spyros deserves congratulations for changing the landscape of forecasting research through this series of competitions.
Makridakis &amp;amp; Hibon, (JRSSA 1979) was the first serious attempt at a large empirical evaluation of forecast methods.</description>

      <description>For a second year running, there will be another rOpenSci OzUnconference in Australia. This one will be held in Melbourne, on 26-27 October 2017.
Unlike regular conferences, there are no talks and there is no pre-determined agenda. It brings together scientists, developers, and open data enthusiasts from academia, industry, government, and non-profit to get together for a few days to work on R-related projects. The agenda is mostly decided during the conference itself, and involves participants dividing into small groups to work on the projects of most interest to them.</description>

      <description>I’ve been using R or its predecessors for about 30 years, so I tend to I know a lot about R, but I don’t necessarily know how to use modern R tools. Lately, I’ve been teaching my students the tidyverse approach to data analysis, which means that I need to unlearn some old approaches and to re-learn them using new tools. But old dogs and new tricks…
Yesterday, I was teaching a class where I needed to extract some rows of a data set.</description>

      <description>Once every year, the journal citation reports are released including journal impact factors. This year, the International Journal of Forecasting 2-year impact factor has increased to 2.642 which is the highest it has been in the journal’s history, and puts the journal higher than such notable titles as Journal of the American Statistical Association and just below Management Science.
The 2-year impact factor is the average number of citations for articles published in the previous 2 years.</description>

      <description>For the past few months I’ve been working on a new DataCamp course teaching Forecasting using R. I’m delighted that it is now available for anyone to do.
Course blurb Forecasting involves making predictions about the future. It is required in many situations such as deciding whether to build another power generation plant in the next ten years requires forecasts of future demand; scheduling staff in a call center next week requires forecasts of call volumes; stocking an inventory requires forecasts of stock requirements.</description>

      <guid>https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/nnetar-prediction-intervals/</guid>
      <description>The nnetar function in the forecast package for R fits a neural network model to a time series with lagged values of the time series as inputs (and possibly some other exogenous inputs). So it is a nonlinear autogressive model, and it is not possible to analytically derive prediction intervals. Therefore we use simulation.
Suppose we fit a NNETAR model to the famous Canadian lynx data:

      <guid>https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/kpprize2017/</guid>
      <description>Recently I was privileged to sit on the committee that selects the winner of the Karl Pearson Prize. KP was, of course, an early mathematical statistician, famous for many commonly-used statistical methods and tools including histograms, the correlation coefficient, the method of moments, p-values, the chi-squared test and principal components analysis. He is also infamous for his highly racist views, support for eugenics, anti-semitism and for refusing a knighthood.
All that aside, the job of the committee was to select an English-language article or book published in the last 30 years that has made a stand-alone research contribution, and which has had major influence on one or more of statistical theory, statistical methodology, statistical practice and application.</description>

      <guid>https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/monthly-seasonality/</guid>
      <description>I regularly get asked why I don&amp;rsquo;t consider monthly seasonality in my models for daily or sub-daily time series. For example, this recent comment on my post on seasonal periods, or this comment on my post on daily data. The fact is, I&amp;rsquo;ve never seen a time series with monthly seasonality, although that does not mean it does not exist.
Monthly seasonality is defined as a regular pattern that recurs every month in data that is observed more frequently than monthly.</description>

      <description>This website has gone through several major updates over the years. It began in 1993 as some handcrafted html files, transitioned to Joomla and later to Wordpress. Then it slowly grew into a collection of ten connected Wordpress installations that became increasingly difficult to maintain, and rather slow.
So I&amp;rsquo;ve now converted the entire site to Blogdown/Hugo. Nearly 700 pages of wordpress content have been translated to markdown. I decided to drop a few parts of the site, notably the pages for my 1998 forecasting textbook.</description>

      <description>In what is now a roughly annual event, the forecast package has been updated on CRAN with a new version, this time 8.0.
A few of the more important new features are described below.
Check residuals A common task when building forecasting models is to check that the residuals satisfy some assumptions (that they are uncorrelated, normally distributed, etc.). The new function checkresiduals makes this very easy: it produces a time plot, an ACF, a histogram with super-imposed normal curve, and does a Ljung-Box test on the residuals with appropriate number of lags and degrees of freedom.</description>

      <description>The International Symposium on Forecasting is a little unusual for an academic conference in that it has always had a strong presence of forecasters working in business and industry as well as academic forecasters, mostly at universities. We value the combination and interaction as it helps the academics understand the sorts of problems facing forecasters in practice, and it helps practitioners stay abreast of new methods and developments coming out of forecasting research.</description>

 You use an illustration of a seasonal arima model:
ARIMA(1,1,1)(1,1,1)4
I would like to simulate data from this process then fit a model… but I am unable to find any information as to how this can be conducted… if I set phi1, Phi1, theta1, and Theta1 it would be reassuring that for large n the parameters returned by Arima(foo,order=c(1,1,1),seasonal=c(1,1,1)) are in agreement…
 My answer: Unfortunately arima.</description>

 Dear xxxxx
I am writing concerning manuscript #INTFOR_16xxxxx entitled &amp;ldquo;xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx&amp;rdquo; which you submitted to the International Journal of Forecasting.
Thank you for this submission, but as it consists entirely of the IJF author guidelines, it is not suitable for publication in the IJF.</description>

      <title>Cross-validation for time series</title>

      <guid>https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/tscv/</guid>
      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve added a couple of new functions to the forecast package for R which implement two types of cross-validation for time series.K-fold cross-validation for autoregression The first is regular k-fold cross-validation for autoregressive models. Although cross-validation is sometimes not valid for time series models, it does work for autoregressions, which includes many machine learning approaches to time series. The theoretical background is provided in Bergmeir, Hyndman and Koo (2015). So cross-validation can be applied to any model where the predictors are lagged values of the response variable.</description>

      <description>A major news outlet interviewed me on predictive analytics. Here were my responses. Data mining is not just for tech companies, in fact it can be especially useful for industries which are not typically thought of to be &amp;lsquo;innovative&amp;rsquo; such as agriculture. What are some of the main industries that you think benefit from predictive analysis?
 Any industry that collects data can use data mining and statistical modelling.
Agriculture is becoming a heavy user of data science methods, with data being collected on every aspect of crop or livestock health and development.</description>

      <description>Someone sent me some questions by email, and I decided to answer some of them here. How important is it that I know and understand the underlying mathematical framework to forecasting methods? I understand conceptually how most of them work, but I feel as if I may benefit from truly understanding the math.
 The main benefit of understanding the mathematics behind different forecasting models is to be able to adapt the models when they don&amp;rsquo;t work well for your data.</description>

The previous GEFComs have led to some major advances in forecasting methodology, available via IJF papers by the winning teams. I expect similar developments to arise out of this competition. Winners get to present their work in Cairns, Australia at ISEA2017.</description>

      <guid>https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/forecast-intervals-for-aggregates/</guid>
      <description>A common problem is to forecast the aggregate of several time periods of data, using a model fitted to the disaggregated data. For example, you may have monthly data but wish to forecast the total for the next year. Or you may have weekly data, and want to forecast the total for the next four weeks.
If the point forecasts are means, then adding them up will give a good estimate of the total.</description>

      <guid>https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/forecast-v7-2/</guid>
      <description>I’ve pushed a minor update to the forecast package to CRAN. Some highlights are listed here.
Plotting time series with ggplot2 You can now facet a time series plot like this:
library(forecast) library(ggplot2) lungDeaths &amp;lt;- cbind(mdeaths, fdeaths) autoplot(lungDeaths, facets=TRUE) So autoplot.mts now behaves similarly to plot.mts
 Multi-step fitted values The fitted function has a new argument h to allow computation of in-sample fitted values of more than one-step-ahead. In time series, fitted values are defined as the one-step-forecasts of the data used in training a model.</description>

      <description>It has been well-known since at least 1969, when Bates and Granger wrote their famous paper on “The Combination of Forecasts”, that combining forecasts often leads to better forecast accuracy.
So it is helpful to have a couple of new R packages which do just that: opera and forecastHybrid.
opera Opera stands for “Online Prediction by ExpeRt Aggregation”. It was written by Pierre Gaillard and Yannig Goude, and Pierre provides a nice introduction in the vignette.</description>

      <description>Regular readers will know that the International Symposium on Forecasting is coming to Australia in June 2017. This is the leading international forecasting conference, and one I&amp;rsquo;ve attended every year for the past 17 years.
It will be held in Cairns, Australia &amp;mdash; one of the most beautiful locations in the country (and there is some stiff competition!) and right next to the Great Barrier Reef. Some further information is available on our website (still in progress).</description>

      <description>This is only directly relevant to my Monash students and colleagues, but the same idea might be useful for adapting to other institutions.
Some recent changes in the rmarkdown and bookdown packages mean that it is now possible to produce working papers in exactly the same format as we previously used with LaTeX.Just install the MonashEBSTemplates package from github. You also need a recent version of LaTeX.
Then from within RStudio, create a new document by selecting &amp;ldquo;Rmarkdown&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;From Template&amp;rdquo;, and select &amp;ldquo;Monash EBS Working Paper&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <title>The thief package for R: Temporal HIErarchical Forecasting</title>

      <guid>https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/thief/</guid>
      <description>I have a new R package available to do temporal hierarchical forecasting, based on my paper with George Athanasopoulos, Nikolaos Kourentzes and Fotios Petropoulos. (Guess the odd guy out there!)
It is called “thief” - an acronym for Temporal HIErarchical Forecasting. The idea is to take a seasonal time series, and compute all possible temporal aggregations that result in an integer number of observations per year. For example, a quarterly time series is aggregated to biannual and annual; while a monthly time series is aggregated to 2-monthly, quarterly, 4-monthly, biannual and annual.</description>

So I am posting the data here in case anyone wants to use it for replicating our results, or for other research purposes. The data are split into monthly, quarterly and yearly data.</description>

The GEFCom2014 papers are included in a special section on probabilistic energy forecasting, guest edited by Tao Hong and Pierre Pinson. This is a major milestone in energy forecasting research with the focus on probabilistic forecasting and forecast evaluation done using a quantile scoring method. Only a few years ago I was having to explain to energy professionals why you couldn&amp;rsquo;t use a MAPE to evaluate a percentile forecast.</description>

      <description>Version 7 of the forecast package was released on CRAN about a month ago, but I’m only just getting around to posting about the new features.
The most visible feature was the introduction of ggplot2 graphics. I first wrote the forecast package before ggplot2 existed, and so only base graphics were available. But I figured it was time to modernize and use the nice features available from ggplot2. The following examples illustrate the main new graphical functionality.</description>

      <description>Almost exactly 20 years ago I wrote a paper with Yanan Fan on how sample quantiles are computed in statistical software. It was cited 43 times in the first 10 years, and 457 times in the next 10 years, making it my third paper to receive 500+ citations.
So what happened in 2006 to suddenly increase the citations? I think it was a combination of things: I wrote a new quantile() function (with Ivan Frohne) which made it into R core v2.</description>

      <description>I often see figures with two sets of prediction intervals plotted on the same graph using different line types to distinguish them. The results are almost always unreadable. A better way to do this is to use semi-transparent shaded regions. Here is an example showing two sets of forecasts for the Nile River flow.
library(forecast) f1 = forecast(auto.arima(Nile, lambda=0), h=20, level=95) f2 = forecast(ets(Nile), h=20, level=95) plot(f1, shadecol=rgb(0,0,1,.4), flwd=1, main=&amp;quot;Forecasts of Nile River flow&amp;quot;, xlab=&amp;quot;Year&amp;quot;, ylab=&amp;quot;Billions of cubic metres&amp;quot;) polygon(c(time(f2$mean),rev(time(f2$mean))), c(f2$lower,rev(f2$upper)), col=rgb(1,0,0,.</description>

      <description>From today&amp;rsquo;s email:
 I wanted to ask you about your R forecast package, in particular the Arima() function. We are using this function to fit an ARIMAX model and produce model estimates and standard errors, which in turn can be used to get p-values and later model forecasts. To double check our work, we are also fitting the same model in SAS using PROC ARIMA and comparing model coefficients and output.</description>

 One of my colleagues said that you once said/wrote that you had encountered very few real outliers in your work, and that normally the &amp;ldquo;outlier-looking&amp;rdquo; data points were proper data points that should not have been treated as outliers. Have you discussed this in writing? If so, I would love to read it.
 I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ve ever said or written anything quite like that, and I see lots of outliers in real data.</description>

One of the most remarkable things about Peter was his astonishing productivity, with over 600 papers.

      <description>RStudio has been a life-changer for the way I work, and for how I teach data analysis. I still have a couple of minor frustrations with it, but they are slowly disappearing as RStudio adds features.
I use dual monitors and I like to code on one monitor and have the console and plots on the other monitor. Otherwise I see too little context, and long lines get wrapped making the code harder to read.</description>

Note the downloads figure: 264K/month. I know the package is popular, but that seems crazy. Also, the downloads figure on github only counts the downloads from the RStudio mirror, and ignores downloads from the other 125 mirrors around the world.Here are the top ten downloaded packages from the last month:

      <title>The hidden benefits of open-source software</title>
      <link>https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/oss-benefits/</link>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been having discussions with colleagues and university administration about the best way for universities to manage home-grown software.
The traditional business model for software is that we build software and sell it to everyone willing to pay. Very often, that leads to a software company spin-off that has little or nothing to do with the university that nurtured the development. Think MATLAB, S-Plus, Minitab, SAS and SPSS, all of which grew out of universities or research institutions.</description>

      <description>The Overseas Development Institute Fellowship Scheme sends young postgraduate statisticians (and economists) to work in the public sectors of developing countries in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific on two-year contracts. This is a great way to develop skills and gain experience working within a developing country&amp;rsquo;s government. And you get to live in a fascinating place!
The application process for the 2016-2018 Fellowship Scheme is now open. Students are advised to apply before 17 December 2015 for a chance to be part of the ODI Fellowship Scheme.</description>

      <description>We have two new continuing positions currently being advertised in our department: for lecturer and senior lecturer. Details are on the Monash website. (For those in North America, a lecturer is equivalent to your assistant professor, and a senior lecturer is equivalent to your associate professor. See the Wikipedia article on Australian academic ranks for more information.)
Although the title says &amp;ldquo;Lecturer/Senior Lecturer (Econometrics)&amp;rdquo;, we are interested in a wider range of candidates including statistics and machine learning.</description>

      <description>I prepared the following notes for a consulting client, and I thought they might be of interest to some other people too.
Let \(y_t\) denote the value of the time series at time \(t\), and suppose we wish to fit a trend with correlated errors of the form \[ y_t = f(t) + n_t, \] where \(f(t)\) represents the possibly nonlinear trend and \(n_t\) is an autocorrelated error process.
For example, if \(f(t) = \beta_0+\beta_1 t\) is a linear function, then we can simply set \(x_{1,t}=t\) and define \[ y_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_{1,t} + n_t.</description>

      <description>It is a while since I last updated the CRAN version of the forecast package, so I uploaded the latest version (6.2) today. The github version remains the most up-to-date version and is already two commits ahead of the CRAN version.
This update is mostly bug fixes and additional error traps. The full ChangeLog is listed below. Many unit tests added using testthat.
 Fixed bug in ets() when very short seasonal series were passed in a data frame.</description>

We had a very stimulating and lively discussion about the issues involved. One interesting idea was that reproducibility is on a scale, and we can all aim to move further along the scale towards making our own research more reproducible. For example

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m back in California for the next couple of weeks, and will give the following talk at Stanford and UC-Davis.
Optimal forecast reconciliation for big time series data Time series can often be naturally disaggregated in a hierarchical or grouped structure. For example, a manufacturing company can disaggregate total demand for their products by country of sale, retail outlet, product type, package size, and so on. As a result, there can be millions of individual time series to forecast at the most disaggregated level, plus additional series to forecast at higher levels of aggregation.</description>

      <description>This is a very different book from my usual areas of forecasting and statistics. It is a personal memoir describing my journey of deconversion from Christianity.
Until a few years ago, I was regularly speaking at church conferences internationally, and my books are still used in Bible classes and Sunday Schools around the world. I even helped establish an innovative new church, which became a model for similar churches in other countries.</description>

      <description>I get asked to review journal papers almost every day, and I have to say no to almost all of them. I know it is hard to find reviewers, but many of these requests indicate very lazy editors. So to all the editors out there looking for reviewers, here is some advice.
 Never ask someone who is an editor for another journal. I am handling about 500 submissions per year for the International Journal of Forecasting, and about 10 per year for the Journal of Statistical Software.</description>

      <description>I’ve always struggled with using plotmath via the expression function in R for adding mathematical notation to axes or legends. For some reason, the most obvious way to write something never seems to work for me and I end up using trial and error in a loop with far too many iterations.
So I am very happy to see the new latex2exp package available which translates LaTeX expressions into a form suitable for R graphs.</description>

      <description>This week, I am teaching my Business Analytics class about the bias-variance trade-off. For some reason, the proof is not contained in either ESL or ISL, even though it is quite simple. I also discovered that the proof currently provided on Wikipedia makes little sense in places.
So I wrote my own for the class. It is longer than necessary to ensure there are no jumps that might confuse students.</description>

      <description>Every now and then a commercial software vendor makes claims on social media about how their software is so much better than the forecast package for R, but no details are provided.
There are lots of reasons why you might select a particular software solution, and R isn&amp;rsquo;t for everyone. But anyone claiming superiority should at least provide some evidence rather than make unsubstantiated claims.The M3 forecasting competition was organized by Spyros Makridakis and Michèle Hibon.</description>

The package is based on this paper with Earo and Nikolay.
The basic idea is to measure a range of features of the time series (such as strength of seasonality, an index of spikiness, first order autocorrelation, etc.</description>

It is rated 4.6 stars on Amazon.com with 6 out of 8 reviewers giving it 5 stars (the 3 reviewers on Amazon.</description>

      <description>One of the first things I tell my new research students is to use a reference management system to help them keep track of the papers they read, and to assist in creating bib files for their bibliography. Most of them use Mendeley, one or two use Zotero. Both do a good job and both are free.
I use neither. I did use Mendeley for several years, but it became slower and slower to sync as my reference collection grew.</description>

      <description>Yahoo Labs has just released an interesting new data set useful for research on detecting anomalies (or outliers) in time series data. There are many contexts in which anomaly detection is important. For Yahoo, the main use case is in detecting unusual traffic on Yahoo servers.The data set comprises real traffic to Yahoo services, along with some synthetic data. There are 367 time series in the data set, each of which contains between 741 and 1680 observations recorded at regular intervals.</description>

      <description>This question comes from a comment on another post:
 I&amp;rsquo;ve seen authors citing as many references as possible to try to please potential referees. Many of those references are low quality papers though. Any general guidance about a typical length for the reference section?
 It depends on the subject and style of the paper. I&amp;rsquo;ve written a paper with over 900 citations, but that was a review of time series forecasting over a 25 year period, and so it had to include a lot of references.</description>

That is, I write with light colored text on a dark background. I don&amp;rsquo;t know why this is not the default in more software as it makes a big difference after a few hours of writing.
Most of the time, I am writing using either Sublime Text, RStudio or TeXstudio.</description>

      <description>Every week I reject some papers submitted to the International Journal of Forecasting, without sending the papers off to associate editors or reviewers. Here are five of the most common reasons for rejection.1. Wrong Journal Submissions to the IJF should be about forecasting, obviously. But we often get papers on econometrics, or time series analysis, or something else that is not forecasting. Even if a paper has some implications for forecasting, if these are not discussed at all, the paper is not within scope for the journal.</description>

OVERVIEW Big data is now endemic in business, industry, government, environmental management, medical science, social research and so on. One of the commensurate challenges is how to effectively model and analyse these data.
This workshop will bring together national and international experts in statistical modelling and analysis of big data, to share their experiences, approaches and opinions about future directions in this field.</description>

      <guid>https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/narrow-pi/</guid>
      <description>Almost all prediction intervals from time series models are too narrow. This is a well-known phenomenon and arises because they do not account for all sources of uncertainty. In my 2002 IJF paper, we measured the size of the problem by computing the actual coverage percentage of the prediction intervals on hold-out samples. We found that for ETS models, nominal 95% intervals may only provide coverage between 71% and 87%. The difference is due to missing sources of uncertainty.</description>

      <description>The hts package for R allows for forecasting hierarchical and grouped time series data. The idea is to generate forecasts for all series at all levels of aggregation without imposing the aggregation constraints, and then to reconcile the forecasts so they satisfy the aggregation constraints. (An introduction to reconciling hierarchical and grouped time series is available in this Foresight paper.)
The base forecasts can be generated using any method, with ETS models and ARIMA models provided as options in the forecast.</description>

      <description>Although the Guardian claimed yesterday that I had explained “what went wrong” in the July and August unemployment figures, I made no attempt to do so as I had no information about the problems. Instead, I just explained a little about the purpose of seasonal adjustment.
However, today I learned a little more about the ABS unemployment data problems, including what may be the explanation for the fluctuations. This explanation was offered by Westpac’s chief economist, Bill Evans (see here for a video of him explaining the issue).</description>

      <description>I keep telling students that there are lots of jobs in data science (including statistics), and they often tell me they can&amp;rsquo;t find them advertised. As usual, you do have to do some networking, and one of the best ways of doing it is via a Data Science Meetup. Many cities now have them including Melbourne, Sydney, London, etc. It is the perfect opportunity to meet with local employers, many of which are hiring due to the huge expansion in the use of data analysis in business (aka business analytics).</description>

      <description>The International Institute of Forecasters sponsors workshops every year, each of which focuses on a specific theme. The purpose of these workshops is to facilitate small, informal meetings where experts in a particular field of forecasting can discuss forecasting problems, research, and solutions. Over the years, our workshops have covered topics from Predicting Rare Events, ICT Forecasting, and, most recently, Singular Spectrum Analysis. Often these workshops are associated with a special issue of the International Journal of Forecasting.</description>

      <title>TBATS with regressors</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve received a few emails about including regression variables (i.e., covariates) in TBATS models. As TBATS models are related to ETS models, tbats() is unlikely to ever include covariates as explained here. It won&amp;rsquo;t actually complain if you include an xreg argument, but it will ignore it.
When I want to include covariates in a time series model, I tend to use auto.arima() with covariates included via the xreg argument. If the time series has multiple seasonal periods, I use Fourier terms as additional covariates.</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago I had a Skype chat with Tim Harford, the &amp;ldquo;Undercover Economist&amp;rdquo; for Britain&amp;rsquo;s Financial Times. He was working on an article for the FT on forecasting, and wanted my perspective as an academic forecaster. I mostly talked about what makes some things more predictable than others, as discussed in this blog post. In the end, his article headed in a different direction, so I don&amp;rsquo;t get quoted, but it is still a good read!</description>

      <description>From today’s email:
 I have just finished reading a copy of ‘Forecasting:Principles and Practice’ and I have found the book really interesting. I have particularly enjoyed the case studies and focus on practical applications.
After finishing the book I have joined a forecasting competition to put what I’ve learnt to the test. I do have a couple of queries about the forecasting outputs required. The output required is a quantile forecast, is this the same as prediction intervals?</description>

      <description>I am now using biblatex for all my bibliographic work as it seems to have developed enough to be stable and reliable. The big advantage of biblatex is that it is easy to format the bibliography to conform to specific journal or publisher styles. It is also possible to have structured bibliographies (e.g., divided into sections: books, papers, R packages, etc.) Here is my default setting which should be suitable for almost all statistics and econometrics journals.</description>

      <description>GEFCom 2014 is the most advanced energy forecasting competition ever organized, both in terms of the data involved, and in terms of the way the forecasts will be evaluated.
So everyone interested in energy forecasting should head over to the competition webpage and start forecasting: www.gefcom.org.
This time, the competition is hosted on CrowdANALYTIX rather than Kaggle.
Highlights of GEFCom2014:
 An upgraded edition from GEFCom2012

      <description>At the IIF annual board meeting last month in Rotterdam, I suggested that we provide awards to the top students studying forecasting at university level around the world, to the tune of $100 plus IIF membership for a year. I&amp;rsquo;m delighted that the idea met with enthusiasm, and that the awards are now available. Even better, my second year forecasting subject has been approved for an award.
The IIF have agreed to fund awards for 20 forecasting courses to start with.</description>

      <guid>https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/coherent-population-forecasting/</guid>
      <description>This is an example of how to use the demography package in R for stochastic population forecasting with coherent components. It is based on the papers by Hyndman and Booth (IJF 2008) and Hyndman, Booth and Yasmeen (Demography 2013). I will use Australian data from 1950 to 2009 and forecast the next 50 years.
In demography, &amp;ldquo;coherent&amp;rdquo; forecasts are where male and females (or other sub-groups) do not diverge over time.</description>

But the longer you stay there, the more you realise there are differences that run deep and affect the way you see the world.</description>

      <description>Rolling forecasts are commonly used to compare time series models. Here are a few of the ways they can be computed using R. I will use ARIMA models as a vehicle of illustration, but the code can easily be adapted to other univariate time series models.One-step forecasts without re-estimation The simplest approach is to estimate the model on a single set of training data, and then compute one-step forecasts on the remaining test data.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s a nice introduction to trees, bagging and forests, plus a very brief entree to the LASSO and the elastic net, and to slab and spike regression. Not enough to be able to use them, but ok if you&amp;rsquo;ve no idea what they are. It was more disappointing on boosting (completely ignoring the fact that boosting can be applied in a regression context as well as a classification context), and his comments on causality seemed curiously naive.</description>

      <description>With the latest version of the hts package for R, it is now possible to specify rather complicated grouping structures relatively easily.
All aggregation structures can be represented as hierarchies or as cross-products of hierarchies. For example, a hierarchical time series may be based on geography: country, state, region, store. Often there is also a separate product hierarchy: product groups, product types, packet size. Forecasts of all the different types of aggregation are required; e.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m tired of reading about tests for structural breaks and here&amp;rsquo;s why.
A structural break occurs when we see a sudden change in a time series or a relationship between two time series. Econometricians love papers on structural breaks, and apparently believe in them. Personally, I tend to take a different view of the world. I think a more realistic view is that most things change slowly over time, and only occasionally with sudden discontinuous change.</description>

(See her website for further materials.) This is a paper everyone doing statistics and econometrics should read as it helps to clarify a distinction that is often blurred. In the discussion, the following issues were covered amongst other things.
 The AIC is better suited to model selection for prediction as it is asymptotically equivalent to leave-one-out cross-validation in regression, or one-step-cross-validation in time series.</description>

 I work within a government budget office and sometimes have to forecast fairly simple time series several quarters into the future. Auto.arima() works great and I often get something along the lines of: ARIMA(0,0,1)(1,1,0)[12] with drift as the lowest AICc.
However, my boss (who does not use R) takes issue with low-order AR and MA because &amp;ldquo;you&amp;rsquo;re essentially using forecasted data to make your forecast.&amp;rdquo; His models include AR(10) MA(12)s etc.</description>

      <description>We have an exciting new initiative at Monash University with some new positions in business analytics. This is part of a plan to strengthen our research and teaching in the data science/computational statistics area. We are hoping to make multiple appointments, at junior and senior levels. These are five-year appointments, but we hope that the positions will continue after that if we can secure suitable funding.What is business analytics? You can think of &amp;ldquo;business analytics&amp;rdquo; as the application of data analysis to business problems.</description>

      <description>My research group meets every two weeks. It is always fun to talk about general research issues and new tools and tips we have discovered. We also use some of the time to discuss a paper that I choose for them. Today we discussed Breiman&amp;rsquo;s classic (2001) two cultures paper &amp;mdash; something every statistician should read, including the discussion.
I select papers that I want every member of research team to be familiar with.</description>

      <guid>https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/seven-forecasting-blogs/</guid>
      <description>There are several other blogs on forecasting that readers might be interested in. Here are seven worth following:
 No Hesitations by Francis Diebold (Professor of Economics, University of Pennsylvania). Diebold needs no introduction to forecasters. He primarily covers forecasting in economics and finance, but also xkcd cartoons, graphics, research issues, etc.
 Econometrics Beat by Dave Giles. Dave is a professor of economics at the University of Victoria (Canada), formerly from my own department at Monash University (Australia), and a native New Zealander.</description>

      <title>Errors on percentage errors</title>

      <description>The MAPE (mean absolute percentage error) is a popular measure for forecast accuracy and is defined as $$ \text{MAPE} = 100\text{mean}(|y_t - \hat{y}_t|/|y_t|) $$ where $y_t$ denotes an observation and $\hat{y}_t$ denotes its forecast, and the mean is taken over $t$.
Armstrong (1985, p.348) was the first (to my knowledge) to point out the asymmetry of the MAPE saying that &amp;ldquo;it has a bias favoring estimates that are below the actual values&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Typing tables in LaTeX can get messy, but there are some good tools to simplify the process. One I discovered this week is tablesgenerator.com, a web-based tool for generating LaTeX tables. It also allows the table to saved in other formats including HTML and Markdown. The interface is simple, but it does most things. For complicated tables, some additional formatting may be necessary.
Similar functionality is available via plugins in Excel, OpenOffice and Libreoffice &amp;mdash; useful if the data for the table is already stored in a spreadsheet.</description>

      <description>When watching the TV news, or reading newspaper commentary, I am frequently amazed at the attempts people make to interpret random noise.
For example, the latest tiny fluctuation in the share price of a major company is attributed to the CEO being ill. When the exchange rate goes up, the TV finance commentator confidently announces that it is a reaction to Chinese building contracts. No one ever says &amp;ldquo;The unemployment rate has dropped by 0.</description>

      <description>The leave-one-out cross-validation statistic is given by
 $$ \text{CV} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N e_{[i]}^2, $$  where ${e_{[i]} = y_{i} - \hat{y}_{[i]}} $, the observations are given by $y_{1},\dots,y_{N}$, and $\hat{y}_{[i]}$ is the predicted value obtained when the model is estimated with the $i\text{th}$ case deleted. This is also sometimes known as the PRESS (Prediction Residual Sum of Squares) statistic.
It turns out that for linear models, we do not actually have to estimate the model $N$ times, once for each omitted case.</description>

Since then, there has been a lot of new work in application areas such as call center forecasting and electricity price forecasting. In addition, there are areas we did not cover in 2006 including new product forecasting and forecasting in finance.</description>

      <description>This is a short piece I wrote for the next issue of the Oracle newsletter produced by the International Institute of Forecasters.Special section topics We continue to publish special sections on selected topics. Because of the change in the way regular papers are now handled, we do not publish whole special issues any more. Rather, each issue has regular papers at the front, and if there are any special sections they appear at the back.</description>

We have plans to make this a built-in part of the platform, but for now it is possible to do it using a simple browser extension. This approach allows any website to be highlighted, so is even more useful than if we only had the facility on OTexts.</description>

      <description>This is another situation where Fourier terms are useful for handling the seasonality. Not only is the seasonal period rather long, it is non-integer (averaging 365.25/7 = 52.18). So ARIMA and ETS models do not tend to give good results, even with a period of 52 as an approximation.
Regression with ARIMA errors The simplest approach is a regression with ARIMA errors. Here is an example using weekly data on US finished motor gasoline products supplied (in thousands of barrels per day) from February 1991 to May 2005.</description>

      <description>Following my post on fitting models to long time series, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d tackle the opposite problem, which is more common in business environments.
I often get asked how few data points can be used to fit a time series model. As with almost all sample size questions, there is no easy answer. It depends on the number of model parameters to be estimated and the amount of randomness in the data.</description>

      <description>I received this email today:
 I recall you made this very insightful remark somewhere that, fitting a standard arima model with too much data, ie. a very long time series, is a bad idea.
Can you elaborate why?
I can see the issue with noise, which compounds the ML estimation as the series gets too long. But is there anything else?
 I&amp;rsquo;m not sure where I made a comment about this, but it is true that ARIMA models don&amp;rsquo;t work well for very long time series.</description>

      <title>The forecast mean after back-transformation</title>

      <guid>https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/backtransforming/</guid>
      <description>Many functions in the forecast package for R will allow a Box-Cox transformation. The models are fitted to the transformed data and the forecasts and prediction intervals are back-transformed. This preserves the coverage of the prediction intervals, and the back-transformed point forecast can be considered the median of the forecast densities (assuming the forecast densities on the transformed scale are symmetric). For many purposes, this is acceptable, but occasionally the mean forecast is required.</description>

      <description>It is common to want forecasts to be positive, or to require them to be within some specified range \([a,b]\). Both of these situations are relatively easy to handle using transformations.Positive forecasts To impose a positivity constraint, simply work on the log scale. With the forecast package in R, this can be handled by specifying the Box-Cox parameter \(\lambda=0\). For example, consider the real price of a dozen eggs (1900-1993; in cents):</description>

      <description>Sometimes it is useful to “backcast” a time series — that is, forecast in reverse time. Although there are no in-built R functions to do this, it is very easy to implement. Suppose x is our time series and we want to backcast for \(h\) periods. Here is some code that should work for most univariate time series. The example is non-seasonal, but the code will also work with seasonal data.</description>

There are some minor syntax changes, but the biggest change is speed and scope. This version is many times faster than the previous version and can handle hundreds of thousands of time series without complaining. The speed-up is due to some new research I am doing with Alan Lee (University of Auckland).</description>

      <description>Every year or so, Elsevier asks me to nominate five _International Journal of Forecasting_ papers from the last two years to highlight in their marketing materials as &amp;ldquo;Editor&amp;rsquo;s Choice&amp;rdquo;. I try to select papers across a broad range of subjects, and I take into account citations and downloads as well as my own impression of the paper. That tends to bias my selection a little towards older papers as they have had more time to accumulate citations.</description>

      <description>Dave Giles pointed out on his blog yesterday that my department is currently ranked in the top 10 in the world for econometrics, according to IDEAS. We are also ranked 13th in the world in forecasting. Since IDEAS only covers the economics literature, the forecasting rank does not take account of our work in other areas such as demographic forecasting, and electricity demand forecasting.
These rankings are only a rough indication of quality, but it is nice to see the department being recognized.</description>

      <description>In two weeks I am presenting a workshop at the University of Granada (Spain) on Automatic Time Series Forecasting.
Unlike most of my talks, this is not intended to be primarily about my own research. Rather it is to provide a state-of-the-art overview of the topic (at a level suitable for Masters students in Computer Science). I thought I&amp;rsquo;d provide some historical perspective on the development of automatic time series forecasting, plus give some comments on the current best practices.</description>

      <description>Hastie, Tibshirani and Friedman&amp;rsquo;s Elements of Statistical Learning first appeared in 2001 and is already a classic. It is my go-to book when I need a quick refresher on a machine learning algorithm. I like it because it is written using the language and perspective of statistics, and provides a very useful entry point into the literature of machine learning which has its own terminology for statistical concepts. A free downloadable pdf version is available on the website.</description>

      <guid>https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/nlts/</guid>
      <description>There are quite a few R packages available for nonlinear time series analysis, but sometimes you need to code your own models. Here is a simple example to show how it can be done.
The model is a first order threshold autoregression:
 $$ y_t = \begin{cases} \alpha y_{t-1} + e_t &amp; \text{if $y_{t-1} \le r$}\\ \beta y_{t-1} + \gamma e_t &amp; \text{if $y_{t-1}r$} \end{cases} $$  where $e_t$ is a Gaussian white noise series with variance $\sigma^2$.</description>

      <description>The International Journal of Forecasting is calling for papers on probabilistic energy forecasting. Here are the details (taken from Tao Hong&amp;rsquo;s blog).In today&amp;rsquo;s competitive and dynamic environment, more and more decision making processes in the energy industry are relying on probabilistic forecasts. The applications of probabilistic energy forecasts spread across planning and operations of the entire energy value chain. We are seeking papers from researchers working on the areas of probabilistic energy forecasting.</description>

      <guid>https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/dailydata/</guid>
      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve had several emails recently asking how to forecast daily data in R. Unless the time series is very long, the easiest approach is to simply set the frequency attribute to 7.
y &amp;lt;- ts(x, frequency=7)  Then any of the usual time series forecasting methods should produce reasonable forecasts. For example
library(forecast) fit &amp;lt;- ets(y) fc &amp;lt;- forecast(fit) plot(fc)  When the time series is long enough to take in more than a year, then it may be necessary to allow for annual seasonality as well as weekly seasonality.</description>

Here are some thoughts and highlights of the conference, in no particular order. Håvard Rue spoke on Bayesian computing with INLA and the R-INLA package.</description>

      <description>Akaike&amp;rsquo;s Information Criterion (AIC) is a very useful model selection tool, but it is not as well understood as it should be. I frequently read papers, or hear talks, which demonstrate misunderstandings or misuse of this important tool. The following points should clarify some aspects of the AIC, and hopefully reduce its misuse. The AIC is a penalized likelihood, and so it requires the likelihood to be maximized before it can be calculated.</description>

      <description>This question was posed on crossvalidated.com:
 I have a monthly time series (for 2009-2012 non-stationary, with seasonality). I can use ARIMA (or ETS) to obtain point and interval forecasts for each month of 2013, but I am interested in forecasting the total for the whole year, including prediction intervals. Is there an easy way in R to obtain interval forecasts for the total for 2013?
 I&amp;rsquo;ve come across this problem before in my consulting work, although I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ve ever published my solution.</description>

      <description>Last Thursday (28 March 2013), George Box passed away at the age of 93. He was one of the great statisticians of the last 100 years, and leaves an astonishingly diverse legacy.
When I teach forecasting to my second year commerce students, we cover Box-Cox transformations, Box-Pierce and Ljung-Box tests, and Box-Jenkins modelling, and my students wonder if it is the same Box in all cases. It is. And we don&amp;rsquo;t even go near his work on response surface modelling, design of experiments, quality control or random number generation.</description>

      <description>Prediction intervals and confidence intervals are not the same thing. Unfortunately the terms are often confused, and I am often frequently correcting the error in students&amp;rsquo; papers and articles I am reviewing or editing.
A prediction interval is an interval associated with a random variable yet to be observed, with a specified probability of the random variable lying within the interval. For example, I might give an 80% interval for the forecast of GDP in 2014.</description>

      <description>The ETS modelling framework developed in my 2002 IJF paper (with Koehler, Snyder and Grose), and in my 2008 Springer book (with Koehler, Ord and Snyder), is now available in EViews 8. I had no idea they were even working on it, so it was quite a surprise to be told that EViews now includes ETS models.Here is the blurb from the release notes:
 EViews 8 now offers support for exponential smoothing using the dynamic nonlinear model framework of Hyndman, Koehler, et al.</description>

      <description>When I want to insert figures generated in R into a LaTeX document, it looks better if I first remove the white space around the figure. Unfortunately, R does not make this easy as the graphs are generated to look good on a screen, not in a document.
There are two things that can be done to fix this problem.First, you can reduce the white space generated by R. I use the following function when saving figures in R.</description>

      <description>This year there are no fewer than three forecasting conferences planned for June and July 2013. As well as the annual International Symposium on Forecasting, there is WIPFOR (Workshop on Industry &amp;amp; Practices for FORecasting) to be held in Clamart (near Paris) in June, and a forecasting stream at the EURO2013 conference in Rome in early July. Some details follow, taken from emails sent to me recently.WIPFOR (Clamart, France, 5-7 June 2013) We would like to bring to your attention the Second Workshop on Industry &amp;amp; Practices for FORecasting (WIPFOR) with an emphasis on Modeling and Stochastic Learning for Forecasting in High Dimension.</description>

      <description>Originally, I wrote this blog for my own PhD students and I covered issues to do with research. I called it &amp;ldquo;Research tips&amp;rdquo; because that is what it was meant to be.
However, over time I&amp;rsquo;ve started covering other things of interest to me, and the readership has grown way beyond what I ever expected. So I decided it was time to acknowledge the change of focus with a change of name.</description>

      <title>Out-of-sample one-step forecasts</title>

      <description>It is common to fit a model using training data, and then to evaluate its performance on a test data set. When the data are time series, it is useful to compute one-step forecasts on the test data. For some reason, this is much more commonly done by people trained in machine learning rather than statistics.
If you are using the forecast package in R, it is easily done with ETS and ARIMA models.</description>

      <description>There must be dozens of statistical consulting businesses and organizations in Australia, each specializing in different areas.
I do some consulting work myself, mostly in the forecasting area, but sometimes in other areas of applied statistics including expert witness work in court cases. Email me if you have a project you would like me to take on. However, I often refer potential clients to other statistical consulting groups, as I only have a limited amount of time I can spend on consulting projects.</description>

      <description>I sometimes get asked about forecasting many time series automatically. Here is a recent email, for example:
 I have looked but cannot find any info on generating forecasts on multiple data sets in sequence. I have been using analysis services for sql server to generate fitted time series but it is too much of a black box (or I don’t know enough to tweak/manage the inputs). In short, what package should I research that will allow me to load data, generate a forecast (presumably best fit), export the forecast then repeat for a few thousand items.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m speaking on this topic at the Young Statisticians Conference, 7-8 February 2013.
If you&amp;rsquo;re a young statistician and live in Australia, please book in. It promises to be a great couple of days. Early registrations close on 2 January.
Abstract for my talk:
For 25 years I have been an intrepid statistical consultant, tackling the wild frontiers of real data, real problems and real time constraints. I have faced problems ranging from linguistics to river beds, from making paper plates to selling pies at the MCG, from tax office audits to surveys about the colour purple.</description>

      <description>A few days ago I released version 4.0 of the forecast package for R. There were quite a few changes and new features, so I thought it deserved a new version number. I keep a list of changes in the Changelog for the package, but I doubt that many people look at it. So for the record, here are the most important changes to the forecast package made since v3.0 was released.</description>

      <description>Updated: 21 November 2012
Make is a marvellous tool used by programmers to build software, but it can be used for much more than that. I use make whenever I have a large project involving R files and LaTeX files, which means I use it for almost all of the papers I write, and almost of the consulting reports I produce.If you are using a Mac or Linux, you will already have make installed.</description>

If you think you can&amp;rsquo;t afford it, there is good news! The local SSA Branch is offering financial support to selected young statisticians. Applicants must be student members of the Victorian Branch (to join, see www.statsoc.org.au/join.htm). Successful applicants will be given free conference registration.</description>

      <description>Today I was writing a report which included 20 figures, with the names demandplot1.pdf, demandplot2.pdf, &amp;hellip;, demandplot20.pdf, and all with similar captions. Clearly a loop was required. After all, LaTeX is a programming language, so we should be able to take advantage of its capabilities.I found the forloop package which handled the problem perfectly. My first attempt looked like this:
\newcommand{\demandplot}[1]{\begin{figure}\centering \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./figs/demandplot#1.pdf} \caption{Hourly demand (GW) for zone #1.} \end{figure}} \newcounter{loop} \forloop{loop}{1}{\value{loop}&amp;lt;21}{\demandplot{\arabic{loop}}}  The magic happens in the last line providing a loop from 1 to 20, generating the commands \demandplot{1}, \demandplot{2}, &amp;hellip;, \demandplot{20}.</description>

      <description>The International Institute of Forecasters and SAS have an annual research grant scheme that has been offered for the past ten years. The amounts offered are small (a total of $10K per year, usually split between 2 or 3 projects), but it might be useful for young researchers wanting a bit of funding to help with their forecasting research. The deadline for 2012 has just been extended to 26 October, which is a sure sign that they don&amp;rsquo;t have enough applications yet.</description>

      <description>Forecasters are often met with skepticism. Almost every time I tell someone that I work in forecasting, they say something about forecasting the stock market, or forecasting the weather, usually suggesting that such forecasts are hopelessly inaccurate. In fact, forecasts of the weather are amazingly accurate given the complexity of the system, while anyone claiming to forecast the stock market deserves skepticism. So what is the difference between these two types of forecasts, and can we say anything about what can be reasonably be forecast and what can&amp;rsquo;t?</description>

      <description>This week I&amp;rsquo;m in Cyprus attending the COMPSTAT2012 conference. There&amp;rsquo;s been the usual interesting collection of talks, and interactions with other researchers. But I was struck by two side comments in talks this morning that I&amp;rsquo;d like to mention.
Stephen Pollock: Don&amp;rsquo;t imagine your model is the truth Actually, Stephen said something like &amp;ldquo;economists (or was it econometricians?) have a bad habit of imagining their models are true&amp;rdquo;. He gave the example of people asking whether GDP &amp;ldquo;has a unit root&amp;rdquo;?</description>

      <description>About once a week someone will tell me there is a bug in my forecast package for R because it gives forecasts that are the same for all future horizons. To save answering the same question repeatedly, here is my response.
A point forecast is (usually) the mean of the distribution of a future observation in the time series, conditional on the past observations of the time series. It is possible, even likely in some circumstances, that the future observations will have the same mean and then the forecast function is flat.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve just finished another reviewer report for a journal, and yet again I&amp;rsquo;ve had to make comments about reading the literature. It&amp;rsquo;s not difficult. Before you write a paper, read what other people have done. A simple search on Google scholar will usually do the trick. And before you submit a paper, check again that you haven&amp;rsquo;t missed anything important.
The paper I reviewed today did not cite a single reference from either of the two most active research groups in the area in the last ten years.</description>

      <description>I have argued previously that research papers should be posted online at the same time as they are submitted to a journal. Sometimes people claim that journals don&amp;rsquo;t allow it, which is nonsense. Almost every journal allows it, and many also allow the published version of a paper to appear on your personal website.
Today I discovered a new tool (thanks to the IMU newsletter) which makes it easy to check a journal&amp;rsquo;s policy on this.</description>

      <description>Beamer is far and away the most popular software for presentations amongst researchers in mathematics and statistics. Most conference and seminar talks I attend these days use beamer. Unfortunately, they all look much the same. I think people find beamer themes too hard to modify easily, so a small number of templates get shared around. Even the otherwise wonderful LaTeX Templates site has no beamer examples.
The beamer user guide explains how to make changes but it is not for the faint-hearted (although it is a fantastic resource once you have some expertise).</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve now moved the collection onto DataMarket which provides much better facilities for maintaining and using time series data.</description>

      <description>This post is from my new book Forecasting: principles and practice, available freely online at OTexts.org/fpp/.
A non-seasonal ARIMA model can be written as \begin{equation}\label{eq:c} (1-\phi_1B - \cdots - \phi_p B^p)(1-B)^d y_t = c + (1 + \theta_1 B + \cdots + \theta_q B^q)e_t \end{equation} or equivalently as \begin{equation}\label{eq:mu} (1-\phi_1B - \cdots - \phi_p B^p)(1-B)^d (y_t - \mu t^d/d!) = (1 + \theta_1 B + \cdots + \theta_q B^q)e_t, \end{equation} where $B$ is the backshift operator, $c = \mu(1-\phi_1 - \cdots - \phi_p )$ and $\mu$ is the mean of $(1-B)^d y_t$.</description>

      <description>Every day I receive emails, or comments on this blog, asking for help with R, forecasting, LaTeX, possible research topics, how to install software, or some other thing I&amp;rsquo;m supposed to know something about. Unfortunately, I cannot provide a one-man help service to the rest of the world. I used to reply to all the requests explaining where to go for help, but I stopped replying a while ago as it took too much time to do even that.</description>

      <description>A few years ago, I was working on a project where we measured various characteristics of a time series and used the information to determine what forecasting method to apply or how to cluster the time series into meaningful groups. The two main papers to come out of that project were:
Wang, Smith and Hyndman (2006) Characteristic-​​based clustering for time series data. Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery, 13(3), 335-364.
 Wang, Smith-Miles and Hyndman (2009) “Rule induction for forecasting method selection: meta-​​learning the characteristics of univariate time series”, Neurocomputing, 72, 2581-2594.</description>

      <description>Google has produced another great tool for researchers, this time providing some metrics on journal citations. Google Scholar Metrics allows you to search on journals rather than articles, and to see the average or median h-index for each journal.
For example, a search on &amp;ldquo;forecasting&amp;rdquo; yields the following results:

The h-index is the largest number $h$ such that at least $h$ articles in that publication were cited at least $h$ times each.</description>

      <description>For those who have not read the seminal works of Tufte and Cleveland, please hang your heads in shame. To salvage some sense of self-worth, you can then head over to Solomon Messing&amp;rsquo;s blog where he is starting a series on data visualization based on the principles developed by Tufte and Cleveland (with R examples).
The classics are also worth reading, and remain relevant despite the 20 or 30 years that have elapsed since they appeared.</description>

      <description>I have thought quite a lot about including regressors (i.e. covariates) in exponential smoothing (ETS) models, and I have done it a couple of times in my published work. See my 2008 exponential smoothing book (chapter 9) and my 2008 Tourism Management paper. However, there are some theoretical issues with these approaches, which have come to light through the research of Ahmad Farid Osman, one of our PhD students at Monash University.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a new StackExchange site that might be useful to readers: Academia. It is a Q&amp;amp;A site for academics and those enrolled in higher education.
The draft FAQ says it will cover:
 Life as a graduate student, postdoctoral researcher, university professor
 Transitioning from undergraduate to graduate researcher
 Inner workings of research departments
 Requirements and expectations of academicians
  Judging from the first 89 questions, this is going to be extremely helpful, especially for PhD students.</description>

      <description>Staying in touch with other researchers is important. You need to know about up-coming conferences, seminars, jobs, etc. To this end, it is worth finding a few key email lists to join. A long list of lists in econometrics and statistics is provided by EconometricLinks. Browse through it to find topics of interest. No doubt researchers in other disciplines have their own lists, but I don&amp;rsquo;t know about them.
For those in Australia and New Zealand, there are two local lists that every statistician and econometrician should be on:</description>

      <description>Almost every research paper and thesis in statistics contains at least some tables, yet students are rarely taught how to make good tables. While the principles of good graphics are slowly becoming part of a statistical education (although not an econometrics education!), the principles of good tables are often ignored. Perhaps people think they are obvious, although the results I see in papers and theses suggest otherwise.Lately the topic seems to have been getting some much-needed attention and the following resources may be useful.</description>

      <description>A great new feature has been added to Google Scholar Citations. For those authors who have set up a citations page, it is now possible to get email alerts for any new articles they publish, or for any new citations of their articles. So you can track citations to your own work this way, and stay up-to-date with key authors in your field.
Setting up a Google Citations page is super-easy and was already worth doing.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve written briefly on this before. For an excellent and more detailed discussion of what is involved, there is a series of excellent posts on Pat Thomson&amp;rsquo;s blog:
 Refereeing a journal article part 1: reading
 Refereeing a journal article part 2: making a recommendation
 Refereeing a journal article part 3: writing the feedback
  If every reviewer followed her advice, my life as an editor would be much easier, and the quality of research would be improved.</description>

 I am preparing a thesis &amp;hellip; I need to conduct the widest possible poll, and it occurred to me that perhaps you could guide me toward an internet-based way in which this can be done easily. I have a ten-question questionnaire prepared, that I wish to have an random sample of the population respond to. I have no budget for this, so I hope you can suggest a way in which a good number of responses can be harvested using blogs or sites you may be aware of.</description>

      <description>I was interviewed recently for the Boston Globe. The interview was by email and I thought it might be useful to post here.Here are the questions from the journalist.
 Are we better at predicting future events than we used to be? Or are there obstacles inherent to the endeavor that prevent us from ever really being able to do it accurately? If we are better, then what allowed it? Computational power?</description>

      <description>Whether travelling to a seminar or conference, or just having a holiday, using a travel organizer can make the process simpler and easier. A good travel organizer keeps all your travel details (flights, hotels, car rentals, meetings, weather forecasts, etc.) organized and synced to whatever devices you use (two computers, an iPad and an iPhone in my case).I am aware of four travel organizers that do this: TripIt, TripCase, WorldMate and Wipolo.</description>

      <description>I gave this talk on Forecasting time series using R for the Melbourne Users of R Network (MelbURN) on Thursday 27 October 2011.
Slides Examples
Abstract I look at the various facilities for time series forecasting available in R, concentrating on the forecast package. This package implements several automatic methods for forecasting time series including forecasts from ARIMA models, ARFIMA models and exponential smoothing models. I also look more generally at how to go about forecasting non-seasonal data, seasonal data, seasonal data with high frequency, and seasonal data with multiple frequencies.</description>

      <description>These terms get confused all the time (e.g., this question on CrossValidated.com), and so I thought it might be helpful to try to summarize the distinction and some of the associated models.Definitions A seasonal pattern exists when a series is influenced by seasonal factors (e.g., the quarter of the year, the month, or day of the week). Seasonality is always of a fixed and known period. Hence, seasonal time series are sometimes called periodic time series.</description>

      <description>This is a gem of a book. It will become the book I give PhD students when they are learning how to write good R code. That is, if I ever see it again. I had hoped to write a review of it, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen it since it arrived in the mail a couple of weeks ago because a research student or research assistant has always had it on loan.</description>

      <description>A researcher portal is a website that attempts to list all the publications of a given researcher. Some portals also allow sharing papers, interacting with other researchers, calculating citation statistics, etc. Every researcher wants their work read and cited, so these websites can be useful tools for getting your work noticed. They can also function as a de facto home page if you don&amp;rsquo;t already have a personal website. Conversely, they can be a good way to find new work by researchers in your field.</description>

      <description>I asked my research group recently what they wished they had learned before they started work on a PhD. Here are some of the responses. More mathematics. Particular topics they named included real analysis, functional analysis, measure theory, algebra, linear algebra. That would have been my response also. I still wish I knew more mathematics than I do. I did quite a lot of mathematics as an undergraduate, but every year I need to learn some more.</description>

      <description>I often get email from forecasters wanting assistance. As much as I&amp;rsquo;d like to provide a free forecasting advice service to the world, that&amp;rsquo;s not what I&amp;rsquo;m paid to do, and I choose to spend my unpaid time on other things. However, there are some very helpful resources available for forecasting practitioners.First, every practicing forecaster should be reading Foresight. It is far and away the best journal or magazine for forecast practitioners.</description>

      <description>Academic publishing is built on an old model where publishers were needed to print and distribute journals to libraries. Under this system, it makes sense that the journals are distributed by publishing companies who charge fees for their work. On the other hand, the academics who write for the journals, the peer reviewers and (almost all) editors, have always contributed their time and expertise without cost. Essentially, they are being paid by universities and other research organizations to do this work.</description>

      <description>I was recently asked how to implement time series cross-validation in R. Time series people would normally call this &amp;ldquo;forecast evaluation with a rolling origin&amp;rdquo; or something similar, but it is the natural and obvious analogue to leave-one-out cross-validation for cross-sectional data, so I prefer to call it &amp;ldquo;time series cross-validation&amp;rdquo;.Here is some example code applying time series CV and comparing 1-step, 2-step, &amp;hellip;, 12-step forecasts using the Mean Absolute Error (MAE).</description>

      <description>The forecast package for R has undergone a major upgrade, and I&amp;rsquo;ve given it version number 3 as a result. Some of these changes were suggestions from the forecasting workshop I ran in Switzerland a couple of months ago, and some have been on the drawing board for a long time. Here are the main changes in version 3, plus a few earlier additions that I thought deserved a mention.</description>

      <description>Forecasting Ace is looking for participants to develop improved methods for predicting future events and outcomes. Their goal is to develop methods for aggregating many individual judgments in a manner that yields more accurate predictions than any one person or small group alone could provide. Potential applications of the system include forecasting economic conditions, political changes, technological development and medical breakthroughs. They are currently seeking to recruit individuals who have interest (and/or expertise) in any of a wide range of current affairs, including but not limited to politics, economics, technology, military affairs, social trends, and science and technology.</description>

For example, support vector machines, neural networks, kernels, clustering, dimension reduction, etc.Statisticians should know something about this area (just as computer scientists working in machine learning should know some statistical modelling), and this would be a great way to learn it.</description>

      <description>Survey articles are particularly helpful in getting a foothold in a new research area, or in looking for important papers that you may have overlooked. Whatever area of research you are in, look out for survey papers and journals dedicated to publishing survey papers.The journal Statistics Surveys is relatively new (volume 1 in 2007) and provides very helpful survey articles of areas of statistical research. It is sponsored by the American Statistical Association, the Bernoulli Society, the Institute of Mathematical Statistics, and by the Statistical Society of Canada.</description>

      <description>It would be nice to have a place to share ideas, links, comments in a very informal way with others involved in research in statistical methodology and data science. CrossValidated.com is great for specific questions, but is not suitable for commenting on papers or sharing ideas and links.Although I have a facebook account, this seems the wrong place to carry out a research discussion because my family and friends are generally not interested, and it is messy to restrict posts to groups of friends.</description>

      <description>Peter Kennedy was an associate editor of the International Journal of Forecasting and a superb applied econometrician. He died unexpectedly in August 2010. He was best known for his excellent book _A Guide to Econometrics_ as well as his &amp;ldquo;Ten Commandments of Applied Econometrics&amp;rdquo;. He provided a variation on his ten commandments in advice to his students in the form of the following ten rules: Use common sense (and economic theory)</description>

      <description>I received an email today with the following comment:
 I’m using ARIMA with Intervention detection and was planning to use your package to identify my initial ARIMA model for later iteration, however I found that sometimes the auto.arima function returns a model where AR/MA coefficients are not significant. So my question is: Is there a way to filter the search for ARIMA models that only have significant coefficients. I can remove the non-significant coefficients but I think it would be better to search for those models that only have significant coefficients.</description>

      <description>For many years I used RWinEdt as my text editor for R code, but when WinEdt 6.0 came out, RWinEdt stopped working. So I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking for something to replace it. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried Tinn-R, NppToR, Eclipse with StatET and a couple of other editors, but nothing was quite right.
Then yesterday, out of the blue, RStudio was announced and it looks fantastic! A screenshot is given below.

The window contains a smart editor with code completion and tabbing, console, workspace with viewable objects, plotting panel with history, etc.</description>

      <description>With the constant pressure on academics to publish research papers, there is a temptation for research groups to include &amp;ldquo;coauthors&amp;rdquo; who have not really made any contribution to the manuscript. This seems more prevalent in some fields (e.g., the health sciences) than others.
Occasionally, I am asked to add an author to a paper that has already been accepted for publication in the International Journal of Forecasting. I am very reluctant to do this as it is hard to imagine how someone could be left off a paper while it goes through several revisions, only to be remembered after the paper is accepted.</description>

      <description>I regularly get emails from people wanting to be referees for the International Journal of Forecasting, usually with an accompanying CV. This is not how the process works.
Referees are almost always selected because they have previously written papers on a similar topic to the manuscript under review. If you want to be a referee, then write good papers and get them published in scholarly journals. Very quickly you will be invited to referee papers in the same journals.</description>

      <description>The Holt-Winters method is a popular and effective approach to forecasting seasonal time series. But different implementations will give different forecasts, depending on how the method is initialized and how the smoothing parameters are selected. In this post I will discuss various initialization methods.
Suppose the time series is denoted by $y_1,\dots,y_n$ and the seasonal period is $m$ (e.g., $m=12$ for monthly data). Let $\hat{y}_{t+h|t}$ be the $h$-step forecast made using data to time $t$.</description>

      <description>Every researcher needs a Curriculum Vitae (Latin for &amp;ldquo;course of life&amp;rdquo;) or CV. You will need it for job applications, for annual performance appraisal, and just for keeping track of your publications. A CV typically contains lists of achievements including qualifications, publications, presentations, awards, plus teaching experience.
I&amp;rsquo;ve created a LaTeX style for a CV to make it easy to produce something that looks good and is easy to maintain. You will need an up-to-date implementation of LaTeX because I&amp;rsquo;m using the wonderful biblatex package (more on that in another post) which has only just become available as part of MikTeX and TeXLive.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve had a few emails lately about forecast evaluation and estimation criteria. Here is one I received today, along with some comments.
 I have a rather simple question regarding the use of MSE as opposed to MAD and MAPE. If the parameters of a time series model are estimated by minimizing MSE, why do we evaluate the model using some other metric, e.g., MAD and MAPE. I could see that MAPE is not scale dependent.</description>

First, read the instructions on how to apply.
Second, poke around my website to see the sorts of topics I work on. There&amp;rsquo;s no point asking to do a PhD with me if you want to do research on something I don&amp;rsquo;t know much about. In particular, please note that I&amp;rsquo;m not really interested in finance or economics.</description>

XeLaTeX is essentially a replacement for pdfLaTeX. It was primarily developed to enable better font handling, especially non-Roman scripts. If you want to write in Telugu, then XeLaTeX is going to make your life much easier.</description>

      <description>This was the topic of a recent conversation on the Australian and New Zealand R mailing list. Here is an edited list of some of the comments made.
 R is free.
 R is well-documented.
 R runs (really well) on *nix as well as Windows and Mac OS.
 R is open-source. Trust in the R software is evident by its support among distinguished statisticians. However, the R user need not rely on trust, as the source code for R is freely available for public scrutiny.</description>

      <description>There is often confusion about how to include covariates in ARIMA models, and the presentation of the subject in various textbooks and in R help files has not helped the confusion. So I thought I&amp;rsquo;d give my take on the issue. To keep it simple, I will only describe non-seasonal ARIMA models although the ideas are easily extended to include seasonal terms. I will include only one covariate in the models although it is easy to extend the results to multiple covariates.</description>

      <title>Why every statistician should know about cross-validation</title>

      <guid>https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/crossvalidation/</guid>
      <description>Surprisingly, many statisticians see cross-validation as something data miners do, but not a core statistical technique. I thought it might be helpful to summarize the role of cross-validation in statistics, especially as it is proposed that the Q&amp;amp;A site at stats.stackexchange.com should be renamed CrossValidated.com.
Cross-validation is primarily a way of measuring the predictive performance of a statistical model. Every statistician knows that the model fit statistics are not a good guide to how well a model will predict: high $R^2$ does not necessarily mean a good model.</description>

      <title>Forecasting with long seasonal periods</title>
      <link>https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/longseasonality/</link>

      <guid>https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/longseasonality/</guid>
      <description>I am often asked how to fit an ARIMA or ETS model with data having a long seasonal period such as 365 for daily data or 48 for half-hourly data. Generally, seasonal versions of ARIMA and ETS models are designed for shorter periods such as 12 for monthly data or 4 for quarterly data.
The ets() function in the forecast package restricts seasonality to be a maximum period of 24 to allow hourly data but not data with a larger seasonal frequency.</description>

      <description>The first stage of the tourism forecasting competition on kaggle has finished. This stage involved forecasting 518 annual time series. Twenty one teams beat our Theta method benchmark which is a great result, and well beyond our expectations. Congratulations to Lee Baker for winning stage one.
I am yet to learn what methods the top teams were using, but we hope to write up a paper for the IJF describing the results.</description>

      <description>As a researcher, you want to become known as an expert in your field. You need people to recognize your name and associate it with your research. Consequently, it is important to be consistent in the name you use on publications.
For example, I could write under &amp;ldquo;R Hyndman&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;R J Hyndman&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Rob Hyndman&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Rob J Hyndman&amp;rdquo;, etc. I&amp;rsquo;ve chosen the last of these and I try to use it on all publications.</description>

      <description>I read an interesting post today by Matt Might on &amp;ldquo;10 reasons PhD students fail&amp;rdquo;, and I thought it might be helpful to reflect on some of the barriers to PhD completion that I&amp;rsquo;ve seen. Matt&amp;rsquo;s ideas are not all relevant to Australian PhDs, so I have come up with my own list below. Here are the seven steps to failure.
1. Wait for your supervisor to tell you what to do A good supervisor will not tell you what to do.</description>

      <title>Econometrics and R</title>

      <description>Econometricians seem to be rather slow to adopt new methods and new technology (compared to other areas of statistics), but slowly the use of R is spreading. I&amp;rsquo;m now receiving requests for references showing how to use R in econometrics, and so I thought it might be helpful to post a few suggestions here.  
A useful on-line and free resource is &amp;ldquo;Econometrics in R&amp;rdquo; by Grant Farnsworth. It covers some common econometric methods including heteroskedasticity in regression, probit and logit models, tobit regression, and quantile regression.</description>

Students also ask me how to go about finding a job when they finish their degree. This post is for both groups, hopefully making it easier for them to pair up appropriately.
First, the mainstream media outlets are not usually good places to advertise. It seems that few people read printed newspapers anymore.</description>

      <description>Every week I reject papers submitted to the International Journal of Forecasting because they present new methods without ever attempting to demonstrate that the new methods are better than existing methods. It is a policy of the journal that every new method must be compared to standard benchmarks and existing methods before the paper will even be considered for publication.
For univariate time series methods, it is not difficult. As a minimum, comparisons should be made against a naive method and a standard method such as an ARIMA model.</description>

The paper has been accepted for publication in the International Journal of Forecasting. (When I submit a paper to the IJF it is always handled by another editor. In this case, Mike Clements handled the paper and it went through several revisions before it was finally accepted.</description>

Don&amp;rsquo;t worry if you miss out &amp;mdash; it will only be a week before it is then open to the public.
There is also a StackExchange site proposal for TeX, LaTeX and friends. Presumably that means that most of the LaTeX questions on StackOverflow will then move to this new site.</description>

      <description>It seems that most journals no longer do any serious copy-editing, and the standard of English is falling. Today I was reading an article from the European Journal of Operational Research, which is supposedly a good OR journal (current impact factor over 2). Take this for an example from the first page of this paper:
 If the learned patterns are unstable, the learning tools would produce inconsistent concepts. To overcome this difficult situation, we employed artificial neural networks (ANNs, NNs) for helping the learning task.</description>

      <description>It is very unusual for a newspaper article to cite an academic paper, unless it is in Nature, Science or the Lancet. Mostly, what we write is too technical and assumes too much background knowledge for it to be accessible to anyone but specialists. So I was pleasantly surprised to find a reference to the International Journal of Forecastingin a recent Wall Street Journalarticle. It is a citation of a 1996 article, so in terms of scientific research it is a bit like quoting the Magna Carta, but a citation nevertheless.</description>

      <guid>https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/use-fake-data-and-real-data/</guid>
      <description>When developing new statistical methods, it is very useful to test them on both fake data (i.e., simulations) and real data.
Testing on fake data is useful because then you know the &amp;ldquo;true&amp;rdquo; answer and can check the procedure under ideal conditions. If your method doesn&amp;rsquo;t work when the data are designed for the task, it is unlikely to work in real conditions. Fake data also enables you to test the robustness of your method when the conditions aren&amp;rsquo;t perfect &amp;ndash; for example, try adding some nasty outliers and see if the method still works.</description>

      <title>Should you make your working papers public?</title>

      <description>There seems to be two points of view on this with different practices in different disciplines.
 Some researchers do not make their work public until after it has been accepted for publication in a journal. Until that time, drafts of papers are only circulated to close confidants and usually marked &amp;ldquo;Do not distribute&amp;rdquo;.
 Working papers are published on web sites and in web repositories (such as arXiv or RePEc) as soon as they are finished, at about the same time they are submitted to a journal.</description>

Those results show some of the flaws in Google Scholar &amp;ndash; the dates are not always correct (the first paper listed above appeared in 2004) and there are unresolved duplicates.</description>

      <description>DLMF For nearly 50 years, a standard reference in mathematical work has been Abramowitz and Stegun&amp;rsquo;s (1964) Handbook of Mathematical Functions with Formulas, Graphs, and Mathematical Tables. It has provided a marvellous collection of results and tables that have been indispensable for a generation of mathematicians. I&amp;rsquo;ve used it to look up computationally efficient methods for calculating Bessel functions or gamma functions, or to find one of those trigonometric identities I learned in high school and no longer remember.</description>

Then you need to decide what career path you prefer. In statistics, there are three choices: the academic route, the semi-academic route and the business route.
Academic route Most PhD students would like an academic job. In fact, I think all of my PhD students have rather fancied my job!</description>

      <description>There are several reasons why researchers should be willing to provide referee reports.
 You learn a lot. If the paper is in your area, then writing a referee report forces you to read it very carefully and engage closely with the research of other people in your field. There&amp;rsquo;s no better way of understand what is going on in your field.
 You get better known by the research leaders in your area.</description>

      <description>As an editor, I like to see referee reports comprising three sections:
 A general summary of the paper and the contribution it makes. You need to highlight here what is new and interesting about the paper, as well as give a summary in a few sentences.
 The major problems that need addressing. This is probably the most important section of your report where you explain the main problems. The editor will read this very carefully when deciding whether to accept, reject or invite a revision, so you need to make sure that any problems are clearly explained here.</description>

      <description>Reproducible research One of the best ways to get started with research in a new area is to try to replicate some existing research. In doing so, you will usually gain a much better understanding of the topic, and you will often discover some problems with the research, or develop ideas that will lead to a new research paper.
Unfortunately, a lot of papers are not reproducible because the data are not made available, or the description of the methods are not detailed enough.</description>

      <description>There are some nice online videos available on various aspects of statistics and mathematics that might be helpful to students trying to learn about new areas.
A search on YouTube will lead to a few fairly basic videos.
 Statistics playlists Mathematics playlists  A better place to go is YouTube EDU which contains material from universities.
Something similar is offered at iTunesU
But the best stuff is on Academic Earth.</description>

      <title>Controlling figure and table placement in LaTeX</title>
      <link>https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/latex-floats/</link>

      <description>It can be frustrating trying to get your figures and tables to appear where you want them in a LaTeX document. Sometimes, they just seem to float off onto another page of their own accord. Here is a collection of tools and ideas that help you get control of those pesky floats.Use the placement options: h, t, b and p. For example
\begin{figure}[htb]  causes LaTeX to try to fit the float &amp;ldquo;here&amp;rdquo;, or at the &amp;ldquo;top&amp;rdquo; of the current page (or the next page), or at the &amp;ldquo;bottom&amp;rdquo; of the current page (or the next page).</description>

      <description>Check out the two posts by Galit Shmueli over at Bzst on hypothesis tests: one on the value of p-values and another on one-sided tests.
She says &amp;ldquo;Shockingly enough, people seem to really want to use p-values, even if they don&amp;rsquo;t understand them.&amp;rdquo; That mirrors my experience too. Confidence intervals are much more useful because they provide a measure of the size of an effect, rather than testing if it is equal to some prespecified value.</description>

      <title>Using personal pronouns in research writing</title>

      <description>Should you use &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;we&amp;rdquo; or neither in your thesis or paper?
Thoughts on this have changed over the years. Traditionally, using personal pronouns like &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;we&amp;rdquo; was frowned on. Instead of saying &amp;ldquo;In Section 3, I have compared the results from method X with those of method Y&amp;rdquo;, you were expected to write &amp;ldquo;In section 3, the results from method X are compared with those from method Y&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <guid>https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/attending-research-seminars/</guid>
      <description>Most research students don&amp;rsquo;t seem to attend seminars. When asked, they usually say the seminars are not on their topic, or they don&amp;rsquo;t understand them, or they find them boring, or some other similar reason. I think this is because students don&amp;rsquo;t understand the purpose of research seminars, and have not learned how to listen to them.
Admittedly, many research seminars are badly presented, and seminar speakers also frequently misunderstand the purpose of the seminar, which makes the problem worse.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing a grant application with a 10-page limit, and as usual it is difficult to squeeze everything in. No, I can&amp;rsquo;t just change the font as it has to be 12 point with at least 2 cm margins on an A4 page. Fortunately, LaTeX is packed full of powerful features that help in squeezing it all in. Here are some of the tips I&amp;rsquo;ve used over the years.</description>

      <title>Converting eps to pdf</title>

      <guid>https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/converting-eps-to-pdf/</guid>
      <description>Simply include the package epstopdf. Then when you use pdflatex, the eps files will be automatically converted to pdf at compile time. (The conversion only happens the first time you process the file, and is skipped if there is already a pdf file with the same name.)
For example:
\documentclass{article} \usepackage{graphicx,epstopdf} \begin{document} \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{fig1} \end{document}  Then even though the only graphics file available is fig1.eps, this will still be processed ok using pdflatex or pdftexify.</description>

      <description>It seems everyone has 7 secrets to success, and now someone has hopped on the 7-secrets bandwagon with something for PhD students. Thinkwell is an Australian company offering a seminar and associated work book on &amp;ldquo;The 7 secrets of highly successful PhD students&amp;rdquo;. I bought the book out of curiosity, but &amp;ldquo;book&amp;rdquo; is a gross exaggeration &amp;ndash; only eleven pages of fairly simplistic advice. I hope the seminar has more substance.</description>

      <description>The abstract is probably the most important part of a paper. Many readers will not read anything else, so you need to grab their attention and get your main message across as clearly and succinctly as possible. It is not meant to be an introduction to the paper, but a summary of the paper. In a single paragraph, a reader can learn the purpose of the research, your general approach to the problem, your main results, and the most important conclusions.</description>

      <description>This came up recently on StackOverflow. One of the answers was particularly helpful and I thought it might be worth mentioning here. The idea presented there is to break the code into four files, all stored in your project directory. These four files are to be processed in the following order.
 load.R This file includes all code associated with loading the data. Usually, it will be a short file reading in data from files.</description>

      <description>Mathematics has its own particular conventions and rules when it comes to writing. There have been several attempts to write them down. The most famous is Halmos&amp;rsquo;s excellent essay &amp;ldquo;How to write mathematics&amp;rdquo;. Other good sources of advice are the following two books:
(I reviewed these two books in the Australian and New Zealand Journal of Statistics a few years ago.)
But if you just want a quick summary, I recommend Dave Richeson&amp;rsquo;s blog entry &amp;ldquo;The nuts and bolts of writing mathematics&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Occasionally, the best research is done in long periods of concentrated effort. Allegedly, Isaac Newton used to sometimes write for eight hours standing up without a break.
At other times, taking a break helps the research process. Think of Archimedes and his Eureka moment. Many of my best ideas come while walking, or taking a shower. In fact, I once suggested to my head of department that we should have showers installed in every office as it would increase the quality of our research.</description>

      <description>Suppose you want a function to fit a neural network. What&amp;rsquo;s the best way to find it? Here are three steps that help to find the elusive function relatively quickly.
First, use help.search(&amp;quot;neural&amp;quot;) or the shorthand ??neural. This will search the help files of installed packages for the word &amp;ldquo;neural&amp;rdquo;. Actually, fuzzy matching is used so it returns pages that have words similar to &amp;ldquo;neural&amp;rdquo; such as &amp;ldquo;natural&amp;rdquo;. For a stricter search, use help.</description>

      <description>In many research universities, there can be a tension that arises when great teachers don&amp;rsquo;t publish much. I believe there is a place for excellent teachers who do limited research within a strong research university, but their contribution is considerably enhanced if they share their teaching insights. There are at least three reputable research journals for publishing articles on statistics education:

Terry is Australia&amp;rsquo;s most famous mathematician, our only Field&amp;rsquo;s medalist, and one of the most active mathematical bloggers in the world. He has been described as the &amp;ldquo;Mozart of mathematics&amp;rdquo; for his remarkable precocity and prolific output. The slides of his talk are available on his blog site.
It was an interesting talk, with excellent slides, marred only by the poor sound system and his bad habit of mumbling.</description>

I don&amp;rsquo;t know if it was connected or not, but on the same day a journalist (Richard Pullin) from Reuters phoned me to ask about assessing some economic forecasts. He wanted to compare the accuracy of several economic forecasts for Japan and he wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure how to go about it. I helped him to calculate the MASE for the different forecasts and the results have now been published.</description>

The slides are available here in presentation form or in handout form. Actually, these are an edited version of the slides as I accidentally left out a couple of the photographs in the workshop, and I&amp;rsquo;ve omitted slides that I didn&amp;rsquo;t end up covering in the workshop.</description>

I felt I was not going to be able to finish my thesis, and that I would be better off throwing in the towel and doing something else. Fortunately, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t think of anything better to do, plus I hate giving up on anything, so I persevered and it turned out ok.</description>

      <description>It may come as a shock to discover that a statistician does not like statistical tests. Isn&amp;rsquo;t that what statistics is all about? Unfortunately, in some disciplines statistical analysis does seem to consist almost entirely of hypothesis testing, and therein lies the problem.
The standard practice is to construct a hypothesis test to determine if some attribute of the data is &amp;ldquo;significant&amp;rdquo; or not, with the standard p-value threshold of 5%.</description>

As I don&amp;rsquo;t do any macroeconomic forecasting, I can sit back and smile smugly at some of my colleagues while I work on simpler problems such as forecasting in epidemiology, demography and energy demand.
Some of those colleagues are cited in the Wall Street Journal today. The following quotation is interesting:

      <description>If you use LaTeX, then you probably have a bib file — a data base of all the papers and books that you have cited. It is much more efficient to keep one database in one location, than have multiple copies of it floating around your hard drive. (Or even worse, have different bib files created for different papers.) You might also have a few of your own style files, and again it is best to keep these in a central location and not have duplicates all over the place.</description>

      <description>There seems to be a widespread practice of researchers citing papers they have never even seen, let alone read. For example
 Some papers claim to do something new when it has already been done in one of the papers cited.
 Some articles are cited that apparently have little to do with the reason given for the citation, or which argue the opposite point of view to what is claimed.</description>

I thought it might be useful to collate a few thoughts on the subject.
 No grovelling. I sometimes get response letters that start off with a paragraph of inane and obsequious fawning. The real response only begins after a paragraph of flattery which makes me wonder why I&amp;rsquo;ve never won the Nobel prize.</description>

      <description>All researchers need to maintain a database of papers they have read, cited, or simply noted for later reference. For those of us using LaTeX, the database is in the BibTeX format and is stored as a simple text file (a bib file) that can be edited using a text editor such as WinEdt.
But it is often easier to edit the file using specialist software. My current favourite tool is JabRef.</description>

For several years I&amp;rsquo;ve been using the comprehensive symbol list whenever I need a symbol in LaTeX that I can&amp;rsquo;t recall.</description>

      <description>For years I&amp;rsquo;ve been telling everyone who would listen that MS-Word may sometimes be useful for short notes or for making a &amp;ldquo;Back in 5 minutes&amp;rdquo; sign to stick on your door, but if you want to write a serious document like an academic paper, a book or a thesis, then you should use a serious tool such as LaTeX. For those who are not yet convinced, Ben Klemens has a nice article entitled &amp;ldquo;Why Word is a terrible program&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Having a PhD student is like having a child. I have had many such &amp;ldquo;children&amp;rdquo; graduate, and have another few &amp;ldquo;on the way&amp;rdquo;. (See here for my offspring.)
Going in the other direction, here is my family tree (or one branch of it), compiled from the Mathematical Genealogy Project. Each successive person is the doctoral student of the person before him. (No females here!)

      <description>Most students seem to go to Google first. This is not a good strategy. Google Scholar is much better as it filters out all the junk. Scopus is another engine that aims to do a similar thing. It is better organized but not so complete. ISI WOK is also not as complete as Google Scholar but is particularly good at tracking citations.

      <description>Sir Clive Granger has died at the age of 74. There are some nice obituaries in the New York Times and the Daily Telegraph. Also, his Wikipedia page has some good information. I met Clive on several occasions and he was &amp;ldquo;a scholar and a gentleman&amp;rdquo;, a remarkably humble man given his outstanding achievements and someone who was always willing to help young researchers. The world of forecasting will miss him.</description>

      <description>Neil Postman was Professor of Communication at New York University until his death in 2003. He wrote many wonderfully insightful and thought-provoking articles and books about television, education, technology and childhood. I recently came across a speech he gave in 1998 on &amp;ldquo;Five things we need to know about technological change&amp;rdquo;. Here is an online transcript. The five things are:
 That we always pay a price for technology; the greater the technology, the greater the price.</description>

 Within Google scholar, go to &amp;ldquo;Scholar preferences&amp;rdquo; and under library links search for &amp;ldquo;Monash&amp;rdquo;. Tick the entry &amp;ldquo;Monash University - Check for full text&amp;rdquo;. Then save your preferences (button at bottom of page). Next time you do a Google scholar search, a link labelled &amp;ldquo;Check for full text&amp;rdquo; will appear beside each entry.</description>

      <description>So what is the ultimate job? According to Hal Varian, chief economist at Google, it is being a statistician (see this interview)
Here he is on YouTube with a longer comment:
  Statistics - Dream Job of the next decade
From a keynote presentation to the 2008 Almaden Institute - &amp;ldquo;Innovating with Information&amp;rdquo;.
The full presentation is available at http://www.almaden.ibm.com/institute/agenda.shtml
Hal Varian makes the argument that with data in huge supply and statisticians in short supply, being a statistician has to be the &amp;lsquo;really sexy job for the 2010s&amp;rsquo;.</description>

      <description>While reading students&amp;rsquo; theses and papers recently, I came across various examples of poor latex-ing that I thought would be useful to catalogue.
 Don&amp;rsquo;t set both width and height when using \includegraphics. It distorts the figure. Instead, I suggest using \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{..}
 Be consistent in capitalizing section and subsection headings, and titles in the bibliography. My preferences is to use sentence case throughout.
 When using functions such as max, min, log, exp, sin, cos, etc.</description>

      <title>Tracking changes in LaTeX files</title>

      <guid>https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/tracking-changes-in-latex-files/</guid>
      <description>When I write a paper, it usually goes through many versions before being submitted to a journal. I keep track of the different versions by renaming the file when I&amp;rsquo;m about to make major changes, or when I receive a new version from a coauthor. The files are named file1.tex, file2.tex, etc. where &amp;ldquo;file&amp;rdquo; is replaced by something more meaningful.
It is often useful to be able to compare versions to see what changes have been made, especially when working with coauthors.</description>

      <guid>https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/tracking-changes-in-text-files/</guid>
      <description>A common issue that arises with text files (e.g., R code) is to identify changes that have been made between versions. I usually number my R files as file1.R, file2.R, etc. (with &amp;ldquo;file&amp;rdquo; replaced by something more meaningful),with the number indicating the version of the file. Version numbers change whenever I send the file to someone else to modify, or whenever I make major changes myself.
I often need to know what changes have been made between successive versions.</description>

      <description>I am frequently asked how I manage my time, and how I manage to get so much done. I don&amp;rsquo;t know that my approach is right for everyone, but in case it helps here are some comments on how I work.
One of the main traps that people fall into is to do things that are urgent, but not necessarily important. They react to the urgency of deadlines, and demands of colleagues, and end up spending a lot of time on things that don&amp;rsquo;t really matter much.</description>

      <description>I gave a one-day LaTeX workshop today.
Here is the blurb:
 LaTeX is an extremely powerful markup language for creating structured documents. It is particularly well-suited for documents containing mathematics, but can be used for any document. Those whose publications involve a large number of mathematical equations often use LaTeX rather than MS-Word or some other word processing package. It is the standard writing tool for most research in the mathematical sciences.</description>

 Note that
 Interestingly
 Obviously
 It is clear that
 It is interesting to note that
 very
 quite
 of course
 Notice that
  I agree with him that all of these are overused, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean they should be banned. The words &amp;ldquo;very&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;quite&amp;rdquo; are useful for conveying the strength of a statement.</description>

I find the library useful for keeping track of books that my students and colleagues borrow (I just add a tag containing their name to the book).</description>

      <description>There is a great article in today&amp;rsquo;s Australian by my co-author Peter Hall on the crisis in mathematics &amp;amp; statistics education (with student numbers falling at the same time as the number of jobs is rising).
The most interesting comment is the last paragraph:
 For a nation in the grip of a serious skills shortage in mathematics and statistics, another review is not needed. Action is needed. It should be possible to drive university behaviour in the national interest by foreshadowing that the Government&amp;rsquo;s proposed compacts will include a requirement that mathematics and statistics curriculums be offered in science and technology, education, business and economics courses across the country, taught by professionals in mathematics and statistics.</description>

      <description>A few years ago I did some forecasting work for a commonwealth government department and found that they were forecasting a $5 billion budget using the FORECAST command in Excel. Worse, they were fitting a regression through only three observations and they were not even the most recent observations.
It seems a similar thing has happened again. The Victorian government is projecting water consumption based on a regression through three observations.</description>

      <description>I was thinking of writing a book on doing research in statistics. Instead, I decided to write a blog covering the same material, plus other things that might be of interest to my research team. Topics covered include LaTeX, R, writing and preparing a thesis, writing a journal article, submitting an article to a refereed journal, how to convince editors to publish your work, and writing referee reports. Topics of more specific interest to my research team include forecasting, data visualization and functional data, and local events such as meetups or statistics conferences.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m in the final stages of preparing my new exponential smoothing book for publication and have been learning about some LaTeX indexing tools.
The standard subject index is created using the following procedure:
 Include \index{entry} commands wherever you want an index entry.
 Include \usepackage{makeidx} and \makeindex in the preamble.
 Put a \printindex command where the index is to appear, normally before the \end{document} command.
  The details are well-documented in this tutorial (starting on p9).</description>

Making tables in LaTeX is one of the few areas where LaTeX can be more difficult than a WYSIWYG editor.
Here are some pointers to tools and packages that I have found useful.
 tablesgenerator.com: a web-based tool for generating LaTeX tables.
 Excel2LaTeX: this excel add-in makes it easy to copy a rectangular array of cells in a spreadsheet into a LaTeX document.
 Calc2LaTeX: a similar extension for LibreOffice and OpenOffice.</description>

      <description>Many R users seem to get themselves in a bit of a mess with R files and workspaces scattered across different directories. The R files themselves also get messy and hard to follow. So here is some advice on keeping organized with R:
 Try to keep code strictly indented based on the code structure such as loops, if statements, etc. Every left brace { should be followed by an extra level of indentation which continues until the matching right brace }.</description>
