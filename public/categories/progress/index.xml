      <description>The nature of research is that other people are probably working on similar ideas to you, and it is possible that someone will beat you to publishing them.When I was working on my PhD, I discovered another PhD thesis by Iris Yeung at UKC with almost exactly the same title as mine, and published a year earlier. In those days, a copy of a thesis had to be printed from microfiche, and then posted by snail mail.</description>

      <description>If you find this blog helpful (or even if you don&amp;rsquo;t but you&amp;rsquo;re interested in blogs on research issues and tools), there are a few other blogs about doing research that you might find useful. Here are a few that I read.
 Patter &amp;ndash; Pat Thomson.
 The Thesis Whisperer &amp;ndash; Inger Mewburn.
 The Research Whisperer &amp;ndash; several RMIT researchers.

      <title>Hamming on research</title>

      <description>Richard Hamming was an excellent mathematician who worked at the interface of mathematics and computer science. In 1986 he gave a wonderful talk entitled You and Your Research. Derek Smith on the AMS Graduate Student blog reminded me of it today. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t read it previously, stop work immediately and read it now.</description>

      <description>I read an interesting post today by Matt Might on &amp;ldquo;10 reasons PhD students fail&amp;rdquo;, and I thought it might be helpful to reflect on some of the barriers to PhD completion that I&amp;rsquo;ve seen. Matt&amp;rsquo;s ideas are not all relevant to Australian PhDs, so I have come up with my own list below. Here are the seven steps to failure.
1. Wait for your supervisor to tell you what to do A good supervisor will not tell you what to do.</description>

      <title>The 7 secrets of highly successful PhD students</title>
      <link>https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/7secrets/</link>

      <description>It seems everyone has 7 secrets to success, and now someone has hopped on the 7-secrets bandwagon with something for PhD students. Thinkwell is an Australian company offering a seminar and associated work book on &amp;ldquo;The 7 secrets of highly successful PhD students&amp;rdquo;. I bought the book out of curiosity, but &amp;ldquo;book&amp;rdquo; is a gross exaggeration &amp;ndash; only eleven pages of fairly simplistic advice. I hope the seminar has more substance.</description>
