      <description>On 26-28 September 2017, I will be running my 3-day workshop in Perth on &amp;ldquo;Forecasting: principles and practice&amp;rdquo; based on my book of the same name.
Topics to be covered include seasonality and trends, exponential smoothing, ARIMA modelling, dynamic regression and state space models, as well as forecast accuracy methods and forecast evaluation techniques such as cross-validation.
Workshop participants are expected to be familiar with basic statistical tools such as multiple regression, but no knowledge of time series or forecasting will be assumed.</description>

      <title>Who&#39;s downloading the forecast package?</title>

      <description>The github page for the forecast package currently shows the following information 
Note the downloads figure: 264K/month. I know the package is popular, but that seems crazy. Also, the downloads figure on github only counts the downloads from the RStudio mirror, and ignores downloads from the other 125 mirrors around the world.Here are the top ten downloaded packages from the last month:

      <description>It is now exactly 12 months since the print version of my forecasting textbook with George Athanasopoulos was released on Amazon.com. Although the book is freely available online, it seems that a lot of people still like to buy print books.It&amp;rsquo;s nice to see that it has been getting some good reviews. It is rated 4.6 stars on Amazon.com with 6 out of 8 reviewers giving it 5 stars (the 3 reviewers on Amazon.</description>

The Google Books version is identical to the print version on Amazon (apart from a few typos that have been fixed).
To use the e-book version on an iPad or Android tablet, you need to have the Google Books app installed [iPad, Android].</description>

      <description>The FPP resources page has recently been updated with several new additions including
 R code for all examples in the book. This was already available within each chapter, but the examples have been collected into one file per chapter to save copying and pasting the various code fragments.
 Slides from a course on Predictive Analytics from the University of Sydney.
 Slides from a course on Economic Forecasting from the University of Hawaii.</description>

      <title>Fast computation of cross-validation in linear models</title>
      <link>https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/loocv-linear-models/</link>

      <guid>https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/loocv-linear-models/</guid>
      <description>The leave-one-out cross-validation statistic is given by
 $$ \text{CV} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N e_{[i]}^2, $$  where ${e_{[i]} = y_{i} - \hat{y}_{[i]}} $, the observations are given by $y_{1},\dots,y_{N}$, and $\hat{y}_{[i]}$ is the predicted value obtained when the model is estimated with the $i\text{th}$ case deleted. This is also sometimes known as the PRESS (Prediction Residual Sum of Squares) statistic.
It turns out that for linear models, we do not actually have to estimate the model $N$ times, once for each omitted case.</description>

      <title>Highlighting the web</title>
      <link>https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/highlighting-the-web/</link>

      <description>Users of my new online forecasting book have asked about having a facility for personal highlighting of selected sections, as students often do with print books. We have plans to make this a built-in part of the platform, but for now it is possible to do it using a simple browser extension. This approach allows any website to be highlighted, so is even more useful than if we only had the facility on OTexts.</description>

      <title>Free books on statistical learning</title>
      <link>https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/free-books-on-statistical-learning/</link>

      <description>Hastie, Tibshirani and Friedman&amp;rsquo;s Elements of Statistical Learning first appeared in 2001 and is already a classic. It is my go-to book when I need a quick refresher on a machine learning algorithm. I like it because it is written using the language and perspective of statistics, and provides a very useful entry point into the literature of machine learning which has its own terminology for statistical concepts. A free downloadable pdf version is available on the website.</description>

      <title>My new forecasting book is finally finished</title>

      <description>My new online forecasting book (written with George Athanasopoulos) is now completed. I previously described it on this blog nearly a year ago.
In reality, an online book is never complete, and we plan to continually update it. But it is now at the point where it is suitable for course work, and contains exercises and references.
We hope that users (especially other lecturers) will submit materials such as slides and exercises, that can be shared on the website.</description>

      <description>After years of saying that I was going to write a book to replace Makridakis, Wheelwright and Hyndman (1998), I&amp;rsquo;m finally ready to make an announcement!
My new book is Forecasting: principles and practice, co-authored with George Athanasopoulos. It is available online and free-of-charge. We have written about 2&amp;frasl;3 of the book so far (all of which is already available online), and we plan to finish it by the end of 2012.</description>
