      <description>For a second year running, there will be another rOpenSci OzUnconference in Australia. This one will be held in Melbourne, on 26-27 October 2017.
Unlike regular conferences, there are no talks and there is no pre-determined agenda. It brings together scientists, developers, and open data enthusiasts from academia, industry, government, and non-profit to get together for a few days to work on R-related projects. The agenda is mostly decided during the conference itself, and involves participants dividing into small groups to work on the projects of most interest to them.</description>
