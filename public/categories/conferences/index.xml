      <description>In late June, I will be in New York to teach my 3-day workshop on Forecasting using R. Tickets are available at Eventbrite.
This is the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve taught this workshop in the US, having previously run it in the Netherlands and Australia. It will be based on the 2nd edition of my book &amp;ldquo;Forecasting: Principles and Practice&amp;rdquo; with George Athanasopoulos. All participants will get a print version of the book.</description>

      <description>For the last few years, I have been involved with running a 3-day short course on &amp;ldquo;Data Science for Managers&amp;rdquo;. We have run it twice each year since 2015, and it continues to prove very popular. We have some awesome presenters including Monash University professors Di Cook, Geoff Webb, and Kim Marriott, as well as several very experienced data scientists working in industry.
The next course will be held on 8-10 May 2018.</description>

      <description>For a second year running, there will be another rOpenSci OzUnconference in Australia. This one will be held in Melbourne, on 26-27 October 2017.
Unlike regular conferences, there are no talks and there is no pre-determined agenda. It brings together scientists, developers, and open data enthusiasts from academia, industry, government, and non-profit to get together for a few days to work on R-related projects. The agenda is mostly decided during the conference itself, and involves participants dividing into small groups to work on the projects of most interest to them.</description>

      <description>Last year we had WOMBAT (Workshop Organized by the Monash Business Analytics Team) at the zoo, and MeDaScIn (Melbourne Data Science Initiative) in the city.
This year we are combining forces to hold WOMBAT MeDaScIn 2017.
There will be four days of tutorials (Monday 29 May to Thursday 1 June), and the main conference on Friday 2 June. We have an impressive range of local and international presenters including Yihui Xie (author of Rmarkdown, Knitr, Bookdown, Blogdown and more), Di Cook (data visualization guru), Stephanie Kovalchik (Data Scientist at Tennis Australia), Amy Shi-Nash (Head of Data Science at Commonwealth Bank of Australia), Graham Williams (Director of Data Science at Microsoft) and many more.</description>

      <description>We are still looking for a few more invited sessions for the International Symposium on Forecasting, to be held in Cairns, Australia, 25-28 June 2017.An invited session consists of 3 or 4 talks around a specific, forecasting theme. You are allowed to be one of the speakers in a session you organize (although it is not necessary). Therefore, if you know what you are planning to speak about, all you need to do is find 2 or 3 other speakers who will speak on a related topic, and invite them.</description>

      <title>Forecasting practitioner talks at ISF 2017</title>
      <link>https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/isf2017-practitioners/</link>

      <guid>https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/isf2017-practitioners/</guid>
      <description>The International Symposium on Forecasting is a little unusual for an academic conference in that it has always had a strong presence of forecasters working in business and industry as well as academic forecasters, mostly at universities. We value the combination and interaction as it helps the academics understand the sorts of problems facing forecasters in practice, and it helps practitioners stay abreast of new methods and developments coming out of forecasting research.</description>

      <description>After the great success of the previous two energy forecasting competitions we have run (GEFCom2012 and GEFCom2014), we are holding another one, this time focused on hierarchical probabilistic load forecasting. Check out all the details over on Tao Hong&amp;rsquo;s blog.
The previous GEFComs have led to some major advances in forecasting methodology, available via IJF papers by the winning teams. I expect similar developments to arise out of this competition. Winners get to present their work in Cairns, Australia at ISEA2017.</description>

      <title>Electricity price forecasting competition</title>

      <guid>https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/electricity-price-forecasting-competition/</guid>
      <description>The GEFCom competitions have been a great success in generating good research on forecasting methods for electricity demand, and in enabling a comprehensive comparative evaluation of various methods. But they have only considered price forecasting in a simplified setting. So I&amp;rsquo;m happy to see this challenge is being taken up as part of the European Energy Market Conference for 2016, to be held from 6-9 June at the University of Porto in Portugal.</description>

      <description>One of my PhD students, Thilaksha Tharanganie, has been very successful in getting travel funding to attend conferences. She was the subject of a write-up in today&amp;rsquo;s Monash News.
We encourage students to attend conferences, and provide funding for them to attend one international conference and one local conference during their PhD candidature. Thilaksha was previously funded to attend last year&amp;rsquo;s COMPSTAT in Geneva, Switzerland and IMS conference in Sydney. Having exhausted local funding, she has now convinced several other organizations to support her conference habit.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m currently attending the one day workshop on this topic at QUT in Brisbane. This morning I spoke on &amp;ldquo;Visualizing and forecasting big time series data&amp;rdquo;. My slides are here.
OVERVIEW Big data is now endemic in business, industry, government, environmental management, medical science, social research and so on. One of the commensurate challenges is how to effectively model and analyse these data.
This workshop will bring together national and international experts in statistical modelling and analysis of big data, to share their experiences, approaches and opinions about future directions in this field.</description>

      <description>The International Institute of Forecasters sponsors workshops every year, each of which focuses on a specific theme. The purpose of these workshops is to facilitate small, informal meetings where experts in a particular field of forecasting can discuss forecasting problems, research, and solutions. Over the years, our workshops have covered topics from Predicting Rare Events, ICT Forecasting, and, most recently, Singular Spectrum Analysis. Often these workshops are associated with a special issue of the International Journal of Forecasting.</description>

      <title>Creating a handout from beamer slides</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m about to head off on a speaking tour to Europe (more on that in another post) and one of my hosts has asked for my powerpoint slides so they can print them. They have made two false assumptions: (1) that I use powerpoint; (2) that my slides are static so they can be printed.
Instead, I produced a cut-down version of my beamer slides, leaving out some of the animations and other features that will not print easily.</description>

      <title>Automatic time series forecasting in Granada</title>

      <description>In two weeks I am presenting a workshop at the University of Granada (Spain) on Automatic Time Series Forecasting.
Unlike most of my talks, this is not intended to be primarily about my own research. Rather it is to provide a state-of-the-art overview of the topic (at a level suitable for Masters students in Computer Science). I thought I&amp;rsquo;d provide some historical perspective on the development of automatic time series forecasting, plus give some comments on the current best practices.</description>

      <title>Reflections on UseR! 2013</title>

      <description>This week I&amp;rsquo;ve been at the R Users conference in Albacete, Spain. These conferences are a little unusual in that they are not really about research, unlike most conferences I attend. They provide a place for people to discuss and exchange ideas on how R can be used.
Here are some thoughts and highlights of the conference, in no particular order. Håvard Rue spoke on Bayesian computing with INLA and the R-INLA package.</description>

      <title>Future ISFs</title>

      <description>The next few locations for the International Symposium on Forecasting have been announced:
 2014: Rotterdam, The Netherlands
 2015: Riverside, California, USA
 2016: Santander, Spain
 2017: Cairns, Australia
  The ISF is easily the best forecasting conference, and is held every year in different locations. The 2013 conference finished today in Seoul, South Korea.
I&amp;rsquo;m especially delighted that it is coming back to Australia in 2017. It has only once before been held in Australia, in 2004.</description>
