      <title>Rmarkdown template for a Monash working paper</title>
      <link>https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/rmarkdown-template/</link>

      <description>This is only directly relevant to my Monash students and colleagues, but the same idea might be useful for adapting to other institutions.
Some recent changes in the rmarkdown and bookdown packages mean that it is now possible to produce working papers in exactly the same format as we previously used with LaTeX.Just install the MonashEBSTemplates package from github. You also need a recent version of LaTeX.
Then from within RStudio, create a new document by selecting &amp;ldquo;Rmarkdown&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;From Template&amp;rdquo;, and select &amp;ldquo;Monash EBS Working Paper&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <title>What to cite?</title>
      <link>https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/what-to-cite/</link>

      <description>This question comes from a comment on another post:
 I&amp;rsquo;ve seen authors citing as many references as possible to try to please potential referees. Many of those references are low quality papers though. Any general guidance about a typical length for the reference section?
 It depends on the subject and style of the paper. I&amp;rsquo;ve written a paper with over 900 citations, but that was a review of time series forecasting over a 25 year period, and so it had to include a lot of references.</description>

      <title>Dark themes for writing</title>

      <description>I spend much of my day sitting in front of a screen, coding or writing. To limit the strain on my eyes, I use a dark theme as much as possible. That is, I write with light colored text on a dark background. I don&amp;rsquo;t know why this is not the default in more software as it makes a big difference after a few hours of writing.
Most of the time, I am writing using either Sublime Text, RStudio or TeXstudio.</description>

      <description>This poem was written by David Goddard from the Monash University Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine. It is reproduced here with his permission. The poem won the inaugural Monash University poetry competition and will soon be published in an anthology of contemporary poetry.For those who like this sort of thing (as I do), there is a nice collection of statistical poetry here.

      <description>I am now using biblatex for all my bibliographic work as it seems to have developed enough to be stable and reliable. The big advantage of biblatex is that it is easy to format the bibliography to conform to specific journal or publisher styles. It is also possible to have structured bibliographies (e.g., divided into sections: books, papers, R packages, etc.) Here is my default setting which should be suitable for almost all statistics and econometrics journals.</description>

      <description>Everyone who has written a paper with another author will know it can be tricky making sure you don&amp;rsquo;t end up with two versions that need to be merged. The good news is that the days of sending updated drafts by email backwards and forwards is finally over (having lasted all of 25 years &amp;ndash; I can barely imagine writing papers before email).LaTeX solutions There has been a lot of activity in the development of online LaTeX tools over the last few years.</description>

      <description>I received this email today:
 Dear Professor Hyndman, I was wondering if you could maybe give me some advice on how to organize your research process. I am able to search the literature on a certain topic and identify where there is a question to work with. My main difficult is to organize my paper annotations in order to help me to guide my research process, i.e, how to manage the information gathered in those papers to compose and structure a document which can represent the research developed so far.</description>

      <description>The nature of research is that other people are probably working on similar ideas to you, and it is possible that someone will beat you to publishing them.When I was working on my PhD, I discovered another PhD thesis by Iris Yeung at UKC with almost exactly the same title as mine, and published a year earlier. In those days, a copy of a thesis had to be printed from microfiche, and then posted by snail mail.</description>

      <description>I have argued previously that research papers should be posted online at the same time as they are submitted to a journal. Sometimes people claim that journals don&amp;rsquo;t allow it, which is nonsense. Almost every journal allows it, and many also allow the published version of a paper to appear on your personal website.
Today I discovered a new tool (thanks to the IMU newsletter) which makes it easy to check a journal&amp;rsquo;s policy on this.</description>

      <description>After years of saying that I was going to write a book to replace Makridakis, Wheelwright and Hyndman (1998), I&amp;rsquo;m finally ready to make an announcement!
My new book is Forecasting: principles and practice, co-authored with George Athanasopoulos. It is available online and free-of-charge. We have written about 2&amp;frasl;3 of the book so far (all of which is already available online), and we plan to finish it by the end of 2012.</description>

      <description>Almost every research paper and thesis in statistics contains at least some tables, yet students are rarely taught how to make good tables. While the principles of good graphics are slowly becoming part of a statistical education (although not an econometrics education!), the principles of good tables are often ignored. Perhaps people think they are obvious, although the results I see in papers and theses suggest otherwise.Lately the topic seems to have been getting some much-needed attention and the following resources may be useful.</description>

      <description>I asked my research group recently what they wished they had learned before they started work on a PhD. Here are some of the responses. More mathematics. Particular topics they named included real analysis, functional analysis, measure theory, algebra, linear algebra. That would have been my response also. I still wish I knew more mathematics than I do. I did quite a lot of mathematics as an undergraduate, but every year I need to learn some more.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve happily used WinEdt for all my LaTeX editing for about 15 years and I&amp;rsquo;ve encouraged my whole research team to use it. But I&amp;rsquo;m tired of problems with WinEdt that take up my time.I regularly have requests for help from one of my research team because something in WinEdt is not working properly &amp;mdash; such as pdf synchronization problems, or it is using an old version of MikTeX that no longer updates, or that it has switched to using another pdf viewer without warning.</description>

      <title>Authorship ethics</title>

      <guid>https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/authorship/</guid>
      <description>With the constant pressure on academics to publish research papers, there is a temptation for research groups to include &amp;ldquo;coauthors&amp;rdquo; who have not really made any contribution to the manuscript. This seems more prevalent in some fields (e.g., the health sciences) than others.
Occasionally, I am asked to add an author to a paper that has already been accepted for publication in the International Journal of Forecasting. I am very reluctant to do this as it is hard to imagine how someone could be left off a paper while it goes through several revisions, only to be remembered after the paper is accepted.</description>

      <title>How to avoid annoying a referee</title>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s not a good idea to annoy the referees of your paper. They make recommendations to the editor about your work and it is best to keep them happy. There is an interesting discussion on stats.stackexchange.com on this subject. This inspired my own list below.
 Explain what you&amp;rsquo;ve done clearly, avoiding unnecessary jargon. Don&amp;rsquo;t claim your paper contributes more than it actually does. (I refereed a paper this week where the author claimed to have invented principal component analysis!</description>

      <description>As a researcher, you want to become known as an expert in your field. You need people to recognize your name and associate it with your research. Consequently, it is important to be consistent in the name you use on publications.
For example, I could write under &amp;ldquo;R Hyndman&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;R J Hyndman&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Rob Hyndman&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Rob J Hyndman&amp;rdquo;, etc. I&amp;rsquo;ve chosen the last of these and I try to use it on all publications.</description>

Don&amp;rsquo;t worry if you miss out &amp;mdash; it will only be a week before it is then open to the public.
There is also a StackExchange site proposal for TeX, LaTeX and friends. Presumably that means that most of the LaTeX questions on StackOverflow will then move to this new site.</description>

      <title>The falling standard of English in research</title>

      <guid>https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/english/</guid>
      <description>It seems that most journals no longer do any serious copy-editing, and the standard of English is falling. Today I was reading an article from the European Journal of Operational Research, which is supposedly a good OR journal (current impact factor over 2). Take this for an example from the first page of this paper:
 If the learned patterns are unstable, the learning tools would produce inconsistent concepts. To overcome this difficult situation, we employed artificial neural networks (ANNs, NNs) for helping the learning task.</description>

      <title>Should you make your working papers public?</title>

      <guid>https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/working-papers/</guid>
      <description>There seems to be two points of view on this with different practices in different disciplines.
 Some researchers do not make their work public until after it has been accepted for publication in a journal. Until that time, drafts of papers are only circulated to close confidants and usually marked &amp;ldquo;Do not distribute&amp;rdquo;.
 Working papers are published on web sites and in web repositories (such as arXiv or RePEc) as soon as they are finished, at about the same time they are submitted to a journal.</description>

      <title>Using personal pronouns in research writing</title>

      <description>Should you use &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;we&amp;rdquo; or neither in your thesis or paper?
Thoughts on this have changed over the years. Traditionally, using personal pronouns like &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;we&amp;rdquo; was frowned on. Instead of saying &amp;ldquo;In Section 3, I have compared the results from method X with those of method Y&amp;rdquo;, you were expected to write &amp;ldquo;In section 3, the results from method X are compared with those from method Y&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing a grant application with a 10-page limit, and as usual it is difficult to squeeze everything in. No, I can&amp;rsquo;t just change the font as it has to be 12 point with at least 2 cm margins on an A4 page. Fortunately, LaTeX is packed full of powerful features that help in squeezing it all in. Here are some of the tips I&amp;rsquo;ve used over the years.</description>

      <title>Writing an abstract</title>

      <guid>https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/abstracts/</guid>
      <description>The abstract is probably the most important part of a paper. Many readers will not read anything else, so you need to grab their attention and get your main message across as clearly and succinctly as possible. It is not meant to be an introduction to the paper, but a summary of the paper. In a single paragraph, a reader can learn the purpose of the research, your general approach to the problem, your main results, and the most important conclusions.</description>

      <description>Mathematics has its own particular conventions and rules when it comes to writing. There have been several attempts to write them down. The most famous is Halmos&amp;rsquo;s excellent essay &amp;ldquo;How to write mathematics&amp;rdquo;. Other good sources of advice are the following two books:
(I reviewed these two books in the Australian and New Zealand Journal of Statistics a few years ago.)

      <description>There seems to be a widespread practice of researchers citing papers they have never even seen, let alone read. For example
 Some papers claim to do something new when it has already been done in one of the papers cited.
 Some articles are cited that apparently have little to do with the reason given for the citation, or which argue the opposite point of view to what is claimed.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been spending time writing response letters lately. I&amp;rsquo;ve also been reading lots of response letters from authors wanting their stuff published in the International Journal of Forecasting. I thought it might be useful to collate a few thoughts on the subject.
 No grovelling. I sometimes get response letters that start off with a paragraph of inane and obsequious fawning. The real response only begins after a paragraph of flattery which makes me wonder why I&amp;rsquo;ve never won the Nobel prize.</description>

      <description>For years I&amp;rsquo;ve been telling everyone who would listen that MS-Word may sometimes be useful for short notes or for making a &amp;ldquo;Back in 5 minutes&amp;rdquo; sign to stick on your door, but if you want to write a serious document like an academic paper, a book or a thesis, then you should use a serious tool such as LaTeX. For those who are not yet convinced, Ben Klemens has a nice article entitled &amp;ldquo;Why Word is a terrible program&amp;rdquo;.</description>

 It is clear that
 It is interesting to note that

 of course
 Notice that
  I agree with him that all of these are overused, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean they should be banned. The words &amp;ldquo;very&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;quite&amp;rdquo; are useful for conveying the strength of a statement.</description>
