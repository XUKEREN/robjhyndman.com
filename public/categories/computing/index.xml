      <description>I’ve been using R or its predecessors for about 30 years, so I tend to I know a lot about R, but I don’t necessarily know how to use modern R tools. Lately, I’ve been teaching my students the tidyverse approach to data analysis, which means that I need to unlearn some old approaches and to re-learn them using new tools. But old dogs and new tricks…
Yesterday, I was teaching a class where I needed to extract some rows of a data set.</description>

      <description>This website has gone through several major updates over the years. It began in 1993 as some handcrafted html files, transitioned to Joomla and later to Wordpress. Then it slowly grew into a collection of ten connected Wordpress installations that became increasingly difficult to maintain, and rather slow.
So I&amp;rsquo;ve now converted the entire site to Blogdown/Hugo. Nearly 700 pages of wordpress content have been translated to markdown. I decided to drop a few parts of the site, notably the pages for my 1998 forecasting textbook.</description>

      <description>Hadley Wickham&amp;rsquo;s popular R developer course is coming to Melbourne on 12-13 December 2016. Bookings can be made via Eventbrite.Hadley, of course, is the developer of the wonderful tidyverse set of R packages including ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, readr, purrr, tibble, and many more. He is the author of several books including the new &amp;ldquo;R for Data Science&amp;rdquo;, he is the chief scientist at RStudio, and a fellow cocktail enthusiast.

      <description>Almost exactly 20 years ago I wrote a paper with Yanan Fan on how sample quantiles are computed in statistical software. It was cited 43 times in the first 10 years, and 457 times in the next 10 years, making it my third paper to receive 500+ citations.
So what happened in 2006 to suddenly increase the citations? I think it was a combination of things: I wrote a new quantile() function (with Ivan Frohne) which made it into R core v2.</description>

      <description>I received this email from one of my undergraduate students:
 I&amp;rsquo;m writing to you asking for advice on how to start a career in Data Science. Other professions seem a bit more straight forward, in that accountants for example simply look for Internships and ways into companies from there. From my understanding, the nature of careers in data science seem to be on a project-to-project basis. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how to get my foot stuck in the door.</description>

      <description>RStudio has been a life-changer for the way I work, and for how I teach data analysis. I still have a couple of minor frustrations with it, but they are slowly disappearing as RStudio adds features.
I use dual monitors and I like to code on one monitor and have the console and plots on the other monitor. Otherwise I see too little context, and long lines get wrapped making the code harder to read.</description>

      <description>The github page for the forecast package currently shows the following information 
Note the downloads figure: 264K/month. I know the package is popular, but that seems crazy. Also, the downloads figure on github only counts the downloads from the RStudio mirror, and ignores downloads from the other 125 mirrors around the world.Here are the top ten downloaded packages from the last month:

      <title>The hidden benefits of open-source software</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been having discussions with colleagues and university administration about the best way for universities to manage home-grown software.
The traditional business model for software is that we build software and sell it to everyone willing to pay. Very often, that leads to a software company spin-off that has little or nothing to do with the university that nurtured the development. Think MATLAB, S-Plus, Minitab, SAS and SPSS, all of which grew out of universities or research institutions.</description>

      <description>It is a while since I last updated the CRAN version of the forecast package, so I uploaded the latest version (6.2) today. The github version remains the most up-to-date version and is already two commits ahead of the CRAN version.
This update is mostly bug fixes and additional error traps. The full ChangeLog is listed below. Many unit tests added using testthat.
 Fixed bug in ets() when very short seasonal series were passed in a data frame.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m back in California for the next couple of weeks, and will give the following talk at Stanford and UC-Davis.
Optimal forecast reconciliation for big time series data Time series can often be naturally disaggregated in a hierarchical or grouped structure. For example, a manufacturing company can disaggregate total demand for their products by country of sale, retail outlet, product type, package size, and so on. As a result, there can be millions of individual time series to forecast at the most disaggregated level, plus additional series to forecast at higher levels of aggregation.</description>

      <title>Mathematical annotations on R plots</title>
      <link>https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/latex2exp/</link>

      <guid>https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/latex2exp/</guid>
      <description>I’ve always struggled with using plotmath via the expression function in R for adding mathematical notation to axes or legends. For some reason, the most obvious way to write something never seems to work for me and I end up using trial and error in a loop with far too many iterations.
So I am very happy to see the new latex2exp package available which translates LaTeX expressions into a form suitable for R graphs.</description>

      <description>Every now and then a commercial software vendor makes claims on social media about how their software is so much better than the forecast package for R, but no details are provided.
There are lots of reasons why you might select a particular software solution, and R isn&amp;rsquo;t for everyone. But anyone claiming superiority should at least provide some evidence rather than make unsubstantiated claims.The M3 forecasting competition was organized by Spyros Makridakis and Michèle Hibon.</description>

      <description>The anomalous package provides some tools to detect unusual time series in a large collection of time series. This is joint work with Earo Wang (an honours student at Monash) and Nikolay Laptev (from Yahoo Labs). Yahoo is interested in detecting unusual patterns in server metrics. The package is based on this paper with Earo and Nikolay.
The basic idea is to measure a range of features of the time series (such as strength of seasonality, an index of spikiness, first order autocorrelation, etc.</description>

      <description>This week I uploaded a new version of the forecast package to CRAN. As there were a lot of changes, I decided to increase the version number to 6.0.
The changes are all outlined in the ChangeLog file as usual. I will highlight some of the more important changes since v5.0 here.ETS One of the most used functions in the package is ets() and it provides a stock forecasting engine for many organizations.</description>

      <description>Yahoo Labs has just released an interesting new data set useful for research on detecting anomalies (or outliers) in time series data. There are many contexts in which anomaly detection is important. For Yahoo, the main use case is in detecting unusual traffic on Yahoo servers.The data set comprises real traffic to Yahoo services, along with some synthetic data. There are 367 time series in the data set, each of which contains between 741 and 1680 observations recorded at regular intervals.</description>

      <description>I spend much of my day sitting in front of a screen, coding or writing. To limit the strain on my eyes, I use a dark theme as much as possible. That is, I write with light colored text on a dark background. I don&amp;rsquo;t know why this is not the default in more software as it makes a big difference after a few hours of writing.
Most of the time, I am writing using either Sublime Text, RStudio or TeXstudio.</description>

 I have just finished reading a copy of ‘Forecasting:Principles and Practice’ and I have found the book really interesting. I have particularly enjoyed the case studies and focus on practical applications.
After finishing the book I have joined a forecasting competition to put what I’ve learnt to the test. I do have a couple of queries about the forecasting outputs required. The output required is a quantile forecast, is this the same as prediction intervals?</description>

      <description>Rolling forecasts are commonly used to compare time series models. Here are a few of the ways they can be computed using R. I will use ARIMA models as a vehicle of illustration, but the code can easily be adapted to other univariate time series models.One-step forecasts without re-estimation The simplest approach is to estimate the model on a single set of training data, and then compute one-step forecasts on the remaining test data.</description>

      <description>Last week my research group discussed Hal Varian&amp;rsquo;s interesting new paper on &amp;ldquo;Big data: new tricks for econometrics&amp;rdquo;, Journal of Economic Perspectives, 28(2): 3-28.
It&amp;rsquo;s a nice introduction to trees, bagging and forests, plus a very brief entree to the LASSO and the elastic net, and to slab and spike regression. Not enough to be able to use them, but ok if you&amp;rsquo;ve no idea what they are. It was more disappointing on boosting (completely ignoring the fact that boosting can be applied in a regression context as well as a classification context), and his comments on causality seemed curiously naive.</description>

      <description>With the latest version of the hts package for R, it is now possible to specify rather complicated grouping structures relatively easily.
All aggregation structures can be represented as hierarchies or as cross-products of hierarchies. For example, a hierarchical time series may be based on geography: country, state, region, store. Often there is also a separate product hierarchy: product groups, product types, packet size. Forecasts of all the different types of aggregation are required; e.</description>

This is part of a plan to strengthen our research and teaching in the data science/computational statistics area. We are hoping to make multiple appointments, at junior and senior levels. These are five-year appointments, but we hope that the positions will continue after that if we can secure suitable funding.What is business analytics? You can think of &amp;ldquo;business analytics&amp;rdquo; as the application of data analysis to business problems.</description>

      <description>Typing tables in LaTeX can get messy, but there are some good tools to simplify the process. One I discovered this week is tablesgenerator.com, a web-based tool for generating LaTeX tables. It also allows the table to saved in other formats including HTML and Markdown. The interface is simple, but it does most things. For complicated tables, some additional formatting may be necessary.
Similar functionality is available via plugins in Excel, OpenOffice and Libreoffice &amp;mdash; useful if the data for the table is already stored in a spreadsheet.</description>

      <description>Today I was teaching the honours students in econometrics and economics about LaTeX. Here are some brief instructions on how to set up a LaTeX system on different operating systems.MS-Windows  Download and run the setup program for MikTeX. Choose the “basic” system. Download and run the installer program for TeXstudio.  Then run TeXstudio and start typing.
Mac OS  Download and install MacTeX.  Then run TeXshop and start typing.</description>

      <description>The leave-one-out cross-validation statistic is given by
 $$ \text{CV} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N e_{[i]}^2, $$  where ${e_{[i]} = y_{i} - \hat{y}_{[i]}} $, the observations are given by $y_{1},\dots,y_{N}$, and $\hat{y}_{[i]}$ is the predicted value obtained when the model is estimated with the $i\text{th}$ case deleted. This is also sometimes known as the PRESS (Prediction Residual Sum of Squares) statistic.
It turns out that for linear models, we do not actually have to estimate the model $N$ times, once for each omitted case.</description>

 I have been using your ‘forecast’ package for more than a year now. I was on R version 2.15 until last week, but I am having issues with lubridate package, hence decided to update R version to R 3.0.1. In our organization even getting an open source application require us to go through a whole lot of approval processes. I asked for R 3.0.1, before I get approval for 3.</description>

      <description>Users of my new online forecasting book have asked about having a facility for personal highlighting of selected sections, as students often do with print books. We have plans to make this a built-in part of the platform, but for now it is possible to do it using a simple browser extension. This approach allows any website to be highlighted, so is even more useful than if we only had the facility on OTexts.</description>

      <description>Earlier this week I had coffee with Ben Fulcher who told me about his online collection comprising about 30,000 time series, mostly medical series such as ECG measurements, meteorological series, birdsong, etc. There are some finance series, but not many other data from a business or economic context, although he does include my Time Series Data Library. In addition, he provides Matlab code to compute a large number of characteristics. Anyone wanting to test time series algorithms on a large collection of data should take a look.</description>

      <description>A new version of my hts package for R is now on CRAN. It was completely re-written from scratch. Not a single line of code survived. There are some minor syntax changes, but the biggest change is speed and scope. This version is many times faster than the previous version and can handle hundreds of thousands of time series without complaining. The speed-up is due to some new research I am doing with Alan Lee (University of Auckland).</description>

      <description>In two weeks I am presenting a workshop at the University of Granada (Spain) on Automatic Time Series Forecasting.
Unlike most of my talks, this is not intended to be primarily about my own research. Rather it is to provide a state-of-the-art overview of the topic (at a level suitable for Masters students in Computer Science). I thought I&amp;rsquo;d provide some historical perspective on the development of automatic time series forecasting, plus give some comments on the current best practices.</description>

      <description>There are quite a few R packages available for nonlinear time series analysis, but sometimes you need to code your own models. Here is a simple example to show how it can be done.
The model is a first order threshold autoregression:
 $$ y_t = \begin{cases} \alpha y_{t-1} + e_t &amp; \text{if $y_{t-1} \le r$}\\ \beta y_{t-1} + \gamma e_t &amp; \text{if $y_{t-1}r$} \end{cases} $$  where $e_t$ is a Gaussian white noise series with variance $\sigma^2$.</description>

Here are some thoughts and highlights of the conference, in no particular order. Håvard Rue spoke on Bayesian computing with INLA and the R-INLA package.</description>

      <description>This question was posed on crossvalidated.com:
 I have a monthly time series (for 2009-2012 non-stationary, with seasonality). I can use ARIMA (or ETS) to obtain point and interval forecasts for each month of 2013, but I am interested in forecasting the total for the whole year, including prediction intervals. Is there an easy way in R to obtain interval forecasts for the total for 2013?
 I&amp;rsquo;ve come across this problem before in my consulting work, although I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ve ever published my solution.</description>

      <description>When I want to insert figures generated in R into a LaTeX document, it looks better if I first remove the white space around the figure. Unfortunately, R does not make this easy as the graphs are generated to look good on a screen, not in a document.
There are two things that can be done to fix this problem.First, you can reduce the white space generated by R. I use the following function when saving figures in R.</description>

      <description>It is common to fit a model using training data, and then to evaluate its performance on a test data set. When the data are time series, it is useful to compute one-step forecasts on the test data. For some reason, this is much more commonly done by people trained in machine learning rather than statistics.
If you are using the forecast package in R, it is easily done with ETS and ARIMA models.</description>

 I have looked but cannot find any info on generating forecasts on multiple data sets in sequence. I have been using analysis services for sql server to generate fitted time series but it is too much of a black box (or I don’t know enough to tweak/manage the inputs). In short, what package should I research that will allow me to load data, generate a forecast (presumably best fit), export the forecast then repeat for a few thousand items.</description>

      <description>A few days ago I released version 4.0 of the forecast package for R. There were quite a few changes and new features, so I thought it deserved a new version number.

So for the record, here are the most important changes to the forecast package made since v3.0 was released.</description>

Make is a marvellous tool used by programmers to build software, but it can be used for much more than that.

      <description>Today I was writing a report which included 20 figures, with the names demandplot1.pdf, demandplot2.pdf, &amp;hellip;, demandplot20.pdf, and all with similar captions. Clearly a loop was required. After all, LaTeX is a programming language, so we should be able to take advantage of its capabilities.I found the forloop package which handled the problem perfectly. My first attempt looked like this:
\newcommand{\demandplot}[1]{\begin{figure}\centering \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./figs/demandplot#1.pdf} \caption{Hourly demand (GW) for zone #1.} \end{figure}} \newcounter{loop} \forloop{loop}{1}{\value{loop}&amp;lt;21}{\demandplot{\arabic{loop}}}  The magic happens in the last line providing a loop from 1 to 20, generating the commands \demandplot{1}, \demandplot{2}, &amp;hellip;, \demandplot{20}.</description>

Stephen Pollock: Don&amp;rsquo;t imagine your model is the truth Actually, Stephen said something like &amp;ldquo;economists (or was it econometricians?) have a bad habit of imagining their models are true&amp;rdquo;. He gave the example of people asking whether GDP &amp;ldquo;has a unit root&amp;rdquo;?</description>

      <description>Staying in touch with other researchers is important. You need to know about up-coming conferences, seminars, jobs, etc. To this end, it is worth finding a few key email lists to join. A long list of lists in econometrics and statistics is provided by EconometricLinks. Browse through it to find topics of interest. No doubt researchers in other disciplines have their own lists, but I don&amp;rsquo;t know about them.
For those in Australia and New Zealand, there are two local lists that every statistician and econometrician should be on:</description>

      <description>A researcher portal is a website that attempts to list all the publications of a given researcher. Some portals also allow sharing papers, interacting with other researchers, calculating citation statistics, etc. Every researcher wants their work read and cited, so these websites can be useful tools for getting your work noticed. They can also function as a de facto home page if you don&amp;rsquo;t already have a personal website. Conversely, they can be a good way to find new work by researchers in your field.</description>

Particular topics they named included real analysis, functional analysis, measure theory, algebra, linear algebra. That would have been my response also. I still wish I knew more mathematics than I do. I did quite a lot of mathematics as an undergraduate, but every year I need to learn some more.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve seen some of the notes from this course and it looks to be an excellent broad introduction to machine learning and data mining. For example, support vector machines, neural networks, kernels, clustering, dimension reduction, etc.Statisticians should know something about this area (just as computer scientists working in machine learning should know some statistical modelling), and this would be a great way to learn it.</description>

CrossValidated.com is great for specific questions, but is not suitable for commenting on papers or sharing ideas and links.Although I have a facebook account, this seems the wrong place to carry out a research discussion because my family and friends are generally not interested, and it is messy to restrict posts to groups of friends.</description>

      <description>I received this email today:
 I have a question about the ets() function in R, which I am trying to use for Holt-Winters exponential smoothing. My problem is that I am getting very different estimates of the alpha, beta and gamma parameters using ets() compared to HoltWinters(), and I can&amp;rsquo;t figure out why.
 This is a common question, so I thought the answer might be of sufficient interest to post here.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve happily used WinEdt for all my LaTeX editing for about 15 years and I&amp;rsquo;ve encouraged my whole research team to use it. But I&amp;rsquo;m tired of problems with WinEdt that take up my time.I regularly have requests for help from one of my research team because something in WinEdt is not working properly &amp;mdash; such as pdf synchronization problems, or it is using an old version of MikTeX that no longer updates, or that it has switched to using another pdf viewer without warning.</description>

      <title>RStudio: just what I&#39;ve been looking for</title>

      <description>For many years I used RWinEdt as my text editor for R code, but when WinEdt 6.0 came out, RWinEdt stopped working. So I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking for something to replace it. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried Tinn-R, NppToR, Eclipse with StatET and a couple of other editors, but nothing was quite right.
Then yesterday, out of the blue, RStudio was announced and it looks fantastic! A screenshot is given below.

The window contains a smart editor with code completion and tabbing, console, workspace with viewable objects, plotting panel with history, etc.</description>

      <description>Every couple of years, a new technology has a big impact on how I work. Gmail was one. My iPhone was another. And I rank Dropbox in the same category.
I get three huge benefits in using Dropbox:
 All my files are backed up online. The house can burn down and I know I can still get my files. Also, if I&amp;rsquo;m away from my desktop or laptop, I can still access my files on my iPhone.</description>

      <description>The Holt-Winters method is a popular and effective approach to forecasting seasonal time series. But different implementations will give different forecasts, depending on how the method is initialized and how the smoothing parameters are selected. In this post I will discuss various initialization methods.
Suppose the time series is denoted by $y_1,\dots,y_n$ and the seasonal period is $m$ (e.g., $m=12$ for monthly data). Let $\hat{y}_{t+h|t}$ be the $h$-step forecast made using data to time $t$.</description>

      <description>The CrossValidated Q&amp;amp;A site is now out of beta and the new design and site name is live.

New design The new design looks great, thanks to Jin Yang, our designer-in-residence. Note the normal density icon for accepted answers and the site icon depicting a 5-fold cross-validation (light green for the test set and dark green for the training set). There is a faint background graphic in the header and footer from a program that tracks and plots a person&amp;rsquo;s mouse movement.</description>

      <description>For students who are interested in doing a PhD at Monash under my supervision.
First, read the instructions on how to apply.
Second, poke around my website to see the sorts of topics I work on. There&amp;rsquo;s no point asking to do a PhD with me if you want to do research on something I don&amp;rsquo;t know much about. In particular, please note that I&amp;rsquo;m not really interested in finance or economics.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve had a few questions on this topic lately. Here is an email received today:
 I use Eviews to estimate time series, but I have been checking out R recently, and your Forecast package.
I cannot understand why 2 similar equations in Eviews and R are giving different estimated output. Your insights will be invaluable for my work.
The equations are:
 R: Arima(log(fee), order=c(1,1,0), seasonal=list(order=c(1,0,0), period=4), include.drift=TRUE) Eviews: dlog(fee) c ar(1) sar(1)  Even with include.</description>

      <description>This was the topic of a recent conversation on the Australian and New Zealand R mailing list. Here is an edited list of some of the comments made.
 R is free.
 R is well-documented.
 R runs (really well) on *nix as well as Windows and Mac OS.
 R is open-source. Trust in the R software is evident by its support among distinguished statisticians. However, the R user need not rely on trust, as the source code for R is freely available for public scrutiny.</description>

      <description>Like many people, I use more than one computer and I like to have all my files, bookmarks and other settings synchronized across my computers. Fortunately, that is getting easier as more tools are made available for keeping computers synchronized. So I thought it might be timely to review how to keep computers &amp;ldquo;synced&amp;rdquo;.
 Files: By far the best service is Dropbox. All files within the &amp;ldquo;My Dropbox&amp;rdquo; directory are backed up online and synchronized with any other computer associated with your account.</description>

      <description>The StackExchange site on Statistical Analysis is about to go into private beta testing. This is your last chance to commit if you want to be part of the private beta testing. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry if you miss out &amp;mdash; it will only be a week before it is then open to the public.
There is also a StackExchange site proposal for TeX, LaTeX and friends. Presumably that means that most of the LaTeX questions on StackOverflow will then move to this new site.</description>

      <title>Use fake data and real data</title>

      <guid>https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/use-fake-data-and-real-data/</guid>
      <description>When developing new statistical methods, it is very useful to test them on both fake data (i.e., simulations) and real data.
Testing on fake data is useful because then you know the &amp;ldquo;true&amp;rdquo; answer and can check the procedure under ideal conditions. If your method doesn&amp;rsquo;t work when the data are designed for the task, it is unlikely to work in real conditions. Fake data also enables you to test the robustness of your method when the conditions aren&amp;rsquo;t perfect &amp;ndash; for example, try adding some nasty outliers and see if the method still works.</description>

      <description>About six weeks ago, I proposed that there should be a Stack Exchange site for questions on data analysis, statistics, data mining, machine learning, etc. I can finally report that there has been substantial progress on this.
The formal proposal is now at Area 51 where the scope of the new site is being developed and voted on in a democratic way. The site has been in a private beta state for a week or so, but is now open for anyone to join in.</description>

      <description>A couple of weeks ago, Google scholar added a facility to provide email alerts on new articles associated with specific search queries. First do the search, then click the envelope at top left of screen. For example, here is a search on &amp;ldquo;exponential smoothing&amp;rdquo; since 2000.

Note the envelope at the top marked New! Click it to get the following screen.

Those results show some of the flaws in Google Scholar &amp;ndash; the dates are not always correct (the first paper listed above appeared in 2004) and there are unresolved duplicates.</description>

      <description>DLMF For nearly 50 years, a standard reference in mathematical work has been Abramowitz and Stegun&amp;rsquo;s (1964) Handbook of Mathematical Functions with Formulas, Graphs, and Mathematical Tables. It has provided a marvellous collection of results and tables that have been indispensable for a generation of mathematicians. I&amp;rsquo;ve used it to look up computationally efficient methods for calculating Bessel functions or gamma functions, or to find one of those trigonometric identities I learned in high school and no longer remember.</description>

      <description>Simply include the package epstopdf. Then when you use pdflatex, the eps files will be automatically converted to pdf at compile time. (The conversion only happens the first time you process the file, and is skipped if there is already a pdf file with the same name.)
For example:
\documentclass{article} \usepackage{graphicx,epstopdf} \begin{document} \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{fig1} \end{document}  Then even though the only graphics file available is fig1.eps, this will still be processed ok using pdflatex or pdftexify.</description>

Terry is Australia&amp;rsquo;s most famous mathematician, our only Field&amp;rsquo;s medalist, and one of the most active mathematical bloggers in the world. He has been described as the &amp;ldquo;Mozart of mathematics&amp;rdquo; for his remarkable precocity and prolific output. The slides of his talk are available on his blog site.
It was an interesting talk, with excellent slides, marred only by the poor sound system and his bad habit of mumbling.</description>

But now there is a new tool and it is very neat. Head over to the R tag on StackOverflow.</description>

      <description>If you use LaTeX, then you probably have a bib file — a data base of all the papers and books that you have cited. It is much more efficient to keep one database in one location, than have multiple copies of it floating around your hard drive. (Or even worse, have different bib files created for different papers.) You might also have a few of your own style files, and again it is best to keep these in a central location and not have duplicates all over the place.</description>

      <description>All researchers need to maintain a database of papers they have read, cited, or simply noted for later reference. For those of us using LaTeX, the database is in the BibTeX format and is stored as a simple text file (a bib file) that can be edited using a text editor such as WinEdt.
But it is often easier to edit the file using specialist software. My current favourite tool is JabRef.</description>

 Within Google scholar, go to &amp;ldquo;Scholar preferences&amp;rdquo; and under library links search for &amp;ldquo;Monash&amp;rdquo;. Tick the entry &amp;ldquo;Monash University - Check for full text&amp;rdquo;. Then save your preferences (button at bottom of page). Next time you do a Google scholar search, a link labelled &amp;ldquo;Check for full text&amp;rdquo; will appear beside each entry.</description>

      <title>Tracking changes in LaTeX files</title>

      <guid>https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/tracking-changes-in-latex-files/</guid>
      <description>When I write a paper, it usually goes through many versions before being submitted to a journal. I keep track of the different versions by renaming the file when I&amp;rsquo;m about to make major changes, or when I receive a new version from a coauthor. The files are named file1.tex, file2.tex, etc. where &amp;ldquo;file&amp;rdquo; is replaced by something more meaningful.
It is often useful to be able to compare versions to see what changes have been made, especially when working with coauthors.</description>

      <description>A common issue that arises with text files (e.g., R code) is to identify changes that have been made between versions. I usually number my R files as file1.R, file2.R, etc. (with &amp;ldquo;file&amp;rdquo; replaced by something more meaningful),with the number indicating the version of the file. Version numbers change whenever I send the file to someone else to modify, or whenever I make major changes myself.
I often need to know what changes have been made between successive versions.</description>
