      <description>The Australian Young Statisticians Conference (Feb 2013) is organizing a communication competition. They invite all early-career statisticians (studying, or within 5 years of graduation) to produce a short (3-5 minute) video for the ABS YSC2013 Video Competition, or a static infographic for the ABS YSC2013 Infographic Competition.
Both competitions have a 1st prize of $500, and 2nd prize of $250.
Entries close 16th November, and winners will be notified by mid-December.</description>

      <description>Probably everyone has seen Hans Rosling&amp;rsquo;s famous TED talk by now. If not, here it is:
  I recently came across a couple of other exceptional talks on data visualization:
Hans Rosling again:Â &amp;rdquo;Let my dataset change your mindset&amp;rdquo;. If only all statistics lecturers were this dynamic!
  David McCandless: &amp;ldquo;The beauty of data visualization&amp;rdquo;. Not so exciting as Hans, but some great examples.
  And here&amp;rsquo;s an hour-length documentary hosted by Hans Rosling called &amp;ldquo;The Joy of Stats&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>There are some nice online videos available on various aspects of statistics and mathematics that might be helpful to students trying to learn about new areas.
A search on YouTube will lead to a few fairly basic videos.

Something similar is offered at iTunesU
But the best stuff is on Academic Earth.</description>
