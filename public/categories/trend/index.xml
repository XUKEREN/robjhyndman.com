      <description>I prepared the following notes for a consulting client, and I thought they might be of interest to some other people too.
Let \(y_t\) denote the value of the time series at time \(t\), and suppose we wish to fit a trend with correlated errors of the form  \[ y_t = f(t) + n_t, \]
 where \(f(t)\) represents the possibly nonlinear trend and \(n_t\) is an autocorrelated error process.</description>
