      <description>In late June, I will be in New York to teach my 3-day workshop on Forecasting using R. Tickets are available at Eventbrite.
This is the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve taught this workshop in the US, having previously run it in the Netherlands and Australia. It will be based on the 2nd edition of my book &amp;ldquo;Forecasting: Principles and Practice&amp;rdquo; with George Athanasopoulos. All participants will get a print version of the book.</description>

      <description>The latest version of the forecast package for R is now on CRAN. This is the version used in the 2nd edition of my forecasting textbook with George Athanasopoulos. So readers should now be able to replicate all examples in the book using only CRAN packages.
A few new features of the forecast package may be of interest. A more complete Changelog is also available.

      <description>Prediction competitions are now so widespread that it is often forgotten how controversial they were when first held, and how influential they have been over the years.
To keep this exercise manageable, I will restrict attention to time series forecasting competitions &amp;mdash; where only the history of the data is available when producing forecasts.
Nottingham studies The earliest non-trivial study of time series forecast accuracy was probably by David Reid as part of his PhD at the University of Nottingham (1969).</description>

      <description>The M4 forecasting competition is well under-way, and a few of my PhD students have been working on submissions.
Pablo Montero-Manso, Carla Netto, and Thiyanga Talagala have made an R package containing all of the data (100,000 time series), which should make it substantially easier for other contestants to load the data into R in order to compute forecasts.
Grab the package from this github repository.

      <description>The official guidelines for the M4 competition have now been published, and there have been several developments since my last post on this.
 There is now a prize for prediction interval accuracy using a scaled version of the Mean Interval Score. If the $100(1-\alpha)$% prediction interval for time $t$ is given by $[L_{t},U_{t}]$, for $t=1,\dots,h$, then the MIS is defined as $$\frac{1}{h}\sum_{t=1}^{h} \left[ (U_t-L_t) + \frac{2}{\alpha}(L_t-Y_t)1(Y_t &amp;lt; L_t) + \frac{2}{\alpha}(Y_t-U_t)1(Y_t &amp;gt; U_t) \right] $$ where $Y_t$ is the observation at time $t$.</description>

      <description>This week I have finished preliminary versions of two new R packages for time series analysis. The first (tscompdata) contains several large collections of time series that have been used in forecasting competitions; the second (tsfeatures) is designed to compute features from univariate time series data. For now, both are only on github. I will probably submit them to CRAN after they’ve been tested by a few more people.
tscompdata There are already two packages containing forecasting competition data: Mcomp (containing the M and M3 competition data) and Tcomp (containing the tourism competition data).</description>

      <description>Following my post on the M4 competition yesterday, Spyros Makridakis sent me these comments for posting here.
I would like to thank Rob, my friend and co-author, for his insightful remarks concerning the upcoming M4 competition. As Rob says, the two of us have talked a great deal about competitions and I certainly agree with him about the “ideal” forecasting competition. In this reply, I will explain why I have deviated from the “ideal”, mostly for practical reasons and to ensure higher participation.</description>

      <description>The &amp;ldquo;M&amp;rdquo; competitions organized by Spyros Makridakis have had an enormous influence on the field of forecasting. They focused attention on what models produced good forecasts, rather than on the mathematical properties of those models. For that, Spyros deserves congratulations for changing the landscape of forecasting research through this series of competitions.
Makridakis &amp;amp; Hibon, (JRSSA 1979) was the first serious attempt at a large empirical evaluation of forecast methods.</description>

      <description>For the past few months I’ve been working on a new DataCamp course teaching Forecasting using R. I’m delighted that it is now available for anyone to do.
Course blurb Forecasting involves making predictions about the future. It is required in many situations such as deciding whether to build another power generation plant in the next ten years requires forecasts of future demand; scheduling staff in a call center next week requires forecasts of call volumes; stocking an inventory requires forecasts of stock requirements.</description>

      <title>Prediction intervals for NNETAR models</title>

      <description>The nnetar function in the forecast package for R fits a neural network model to a time series with lagged values of the time series as inputs (and possibly some other exogenous inputs). So it is a nonlinear autogressive model, and it is not possible to analytically derive prediction intervals. Therefore we use simulation.
Suppose we fit a NNETAR model to the famous Canadian lynx data:

      <description>I regularly get asked why I don&amp;rsquo;t consider monthly seasonality in my models for daily or sub-daily time series. For example, this recent comment on my post on seasonal periods, or this comment on my post on daily data. The fact is, I&amp;rsquo;ve never seen a time series with monthly seasonality, although that does not mean it does not exist.
Monthly seasonality is defined as a regular pattern that recurs every month in data that is observed more frequently than monthly.</description>

      <description>In what is now a roughly annual event, the forecast package has been updated on CRAN with a new version, this time 8.0.
A few of the more important new features are described below.
Check residuals A common task when building forecasting models is to check that the residuals satisfy some assumptions (that they are uncorrelated, normally distributed, etc.). The new function checkresiduals makes this very easy: it produces a time plot, an ACF, a histogram with super-imposed normal curve, and does a Ljung-Box test on the residuals with appropriate number of lags and degrees of freedom.</description>

      <description>From my email today
 You use an illustration of a seasonal arima model:
ARIMA(1,1,1)(1,1,1)4
I would like to simulate data from this process then fit a model… but I am unable to find any information as to how this can be conducted… if I set phi1, Phi1, theta1, and Theta1 it would be reassuring that for large n the parameters returned by Arima(foo,order=c(1,1,1),seasonal=c(1,1,1)) are in agreement…
 My answer: Unfortunately arima.</description>

      <guid>https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/tscv/</guid>
      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve added a couple of new functions to the forecast package for R which implement two types of cross-validation for time series.K-fold cross-validation for autoregression The first is regular k-fold cross-validation for autoregressive models. Although cross-validation is sometimes not valid for time series models, it does work for autoregressions, which includes many machine learning approaches to time series. The theoretical background is provided in Bergmeir, Hyndman and Koo (2015). So cross-validation can be applied to any model where the predictors are lagged values of the response variable.</description>

      <description>A common problem is to forecast the aggregate of several time periods of data, using a model fitted to the disaggregated data. For example, you may have monthly data but wish to forecast the total for the next year. Or you may have weekly data, and want to forecast the total for the next four weeks.
If the point forecasts are means, then adding them up will give a good estimate of the total.</description>

      <description>I’ve pushed a minor update to the forecast package to CRAN. Some highlights are listed here.
Plotting time series with ggplot2 You can now facet a time series plot like this:
library(forecast) library(ggplot2) lungDeaths &amp;lt;- cbind(mdeaths, fdeaths) autoplot(lungDeaths, facets=TRUE) So autoplot.mts now behaves similarly to plot.mts
 Multi-step fitted values The fitted function has a new argument h to allow computation of in-sample fitted values of more than one-step-ahead. In time series, fitted values are defined as the one-step-forecasts of the data used in training a model.</description>

      <description>I have a new R package available to do temporal hierarchical forecasting, based on my paper with George Athanasopoulos, Nikolaos Kourentzes and Fotios Petropoulos. (Guess the odd guy out there!)
It is called “thief” - an acronym for Temporal HIErarchical Forecasting. The idea is to take a seasonal time series, and compute all possible temporal aggregations that result in an integer number of observations per year. For example, a quarterly time series is aggregated to biannual and annual; while a monthly time series is aggregated to 2-monthly, quarterly, 4-monthly, biannual and annual.</description>

      <description>Version 7 of the forecast package was released on CRAN about a month ago, but I’m only just getting around to posting about the new features.
The most visible feature was the introduction of ggplot2 graphics. I first wrote the forecast package before ggplot2 existed, and so only base graphics were available. But I figured it was time to modernize and use the nice features available from ggplot2. The following examples illustrate the main new graphical functionality.</description>

 I wanted to ask you about your R forecast package, in particular the Arima() function. We are using this function to fit an ARIMAX model and produce model estimates and standard errors, which in turn can be used to get p-values and later model forecasts. To double check our work, we are also fitting the same model in SAS using PROC ARIMA and comparing model coefficients and output.</description>

Let \(y_t\) denote the value of the time series at time \(t\), and suppose we wish to fit a trend with correlated errors of the form  \[ y_t = f(t) + n_t, \]
 where \(f(t)\) represents the possibly nonlinear trend and \(n_t\) is an autocorrelated error process.</description>

      <description>It is a while since I last updated the CRAN version of the forecast package, so I uploaded the latest version (6.2) today. The github version remains the most up-to-date version and is already two commits ahead of the CRAN version.
This update is mostly bug fixes and additional error traps. The full ChangeLog is listed below. Many unit tests added using testthat.
 Fixed bug in ets() when very short seasonal series were passed in a data frame.</description>

      <description>I gave a seminar at Stanford today. Slides are below. It was definitely the most intimidating audience I&amp;rsquo;ve faced, with Jerome Friedman, Trevor Hastie, Brad Efron, Persi Diaconis, Susan Holmes, David Donoho and John Chambers all present (and probably other famous names I&amp;rsquo;ve missed).
I&amp;rsquo;ll be giving essentially the same talk at UC Davis on Thursday.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m back in California for the next couple of weeks, and will give the following talk at Stanford and UC-Davis.
Optimal forecast reconciliation for big time series data Time series can often be naturally disaggregated in a hierarchical or grouped structure. For example, a manufacturing company can disaggregate total demand for their products by country of sale, retail outlet, product type, package size, and so on. As a result, there can be millions of individual time series to forecast at the most disaggregated level, plus additional series to forecast at higher levels of aggregation.</description>

      <description>Every now and then a commercial software vendor makes claims on social media about how their software is so much better than the forecast package for R, but no details are provided.
There are lots of reasons why you might select a particular software solution, and R isn&amp;rsquo;t for everyone. But anyone claiming superiority should at least provide some evidence rather than make unsubstantiated claims.The M3 forecasting competition was organized by Spyros Makridakis and Michèle Hibon.</description>

      <description>The anomalous package provides some tools to detect unusual time series in a large collection of time series. This is joint work with Earo Wang (an honours student at Monash) and Nikolay Laptev (from Yahoo Labs). Yahoo is interested in detecting unusual patterns in server metrics. The package is based on this paper with Earo and Nikolay.
The basic idea is to measure a range of features of the time series (such as strength of seasonality, an index of spikiness, first order autocorrelation, etc.</description>

      <description>Yahoo Labs has just released an interesting new data set useful for research on detecting anomalies (or outliers) in time series data. There are many contexts in which anomaly detection is important. For Yahoo, the main use case is in detecting unusual traffic on Yahoo servers.The data set comprises real traffic to Yahoo services, along with some synthetic data. There are 367 time series in the data set, each of which contains between 741 and 1680 observations recorded at regular intervals.</description>

      <description>With the latest version of the hts package for R, it is now possible to specify rather complicated grouping structures relatively easily.
All aggregation structures can be represented as hierarchies or as cross-products of hierarchies. For example, a hierarchical time series may be based on geography: country, state, region, store. Often there is also a separate product hierarchy: product groups, product types, packet size. Forecasts of all the different types of aggregation are required; e.</description>

      <description>Following my post on fitting models to long time series, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d tackle the opposite problem, which is more common in business environments.
I often get asked how few data points can be used to fit a time series model. As with almost all sample size questions, there is no easy answer. It depends on the number of model parameters to be estimated and the amount of randomness in the data.</description>

      <description>I received this email today:
 I recall you made this very insightful remark somewhere that, fitting a standard arima model with too much data, ie. a very long time series, is a bad idea.
Can you elaborate why?
I can see the issue with noise, which compounds the ML estimation as the series gets too long. But is there anything else?
 I&amp;rsquo;m not sure where I made a comment about this, but it is true that ARIMA models don&amp;rsquo;t work well for very long time series.</description>

      <description>In two weeks I am presenting a workshop at the University of Granada (Spain) on Automatic Time Series Forecasting.
Unlike most of my talks, this is not intended to be primarily about my own research. Rather it is to provide a state-of-the-art overview of the topic (at a level suitable for Masters students in Computer Science). I thought I&amp;rsquo;d provide some historical perspective on the development of automatic time series forecasting, plus give some comments on the current best practices.</description>

      <description>There are quite a few R packages available for nonlinear time series analysis, but sometimes you need to code your own models. Here is a simple example to show how it can be done.
The model is a first order threshold autoregression:
 $$ y_t = \begin{cases} \alpha y_{t-1} + e_t &amp; \text{if $y_{t-1} \le r$}\\ \beta y_{t-1} + \gamma e_t &amp; \text{if $y_{t-1}r$} \end{cases} $$  where $e_t$ is a Gaussian white noise series with variance $\sigma^2$.</description>

Slides Examples
Abstract I look at the various facilities for time series forecasting available in R, concentrating on the forecast package. This package implements several automatic methods for forecasting time series including forecasts from ARIMA models, ARFIMA models and exponential smoothing models. I also look more generally at how to go about forecasting non-seasonal data, seasonal data, seasonal data with high frequency, and seasonal data with multiple frequencies.</description>

      <description>These terms get confused all the time (e.g., this question on CrossValidated.com), and so I thought it might be helpful to try to summarize the distinction and some of the associated models.Definitions A seasonal pattern exists when a series is influenced by seasonal factors (e.g., the quarter of the year, the month, or day of the week). Seasonality is always of a fixed and known period. Hence, seasonal time series are sometimes called periodic time series.</description>

      <description>I was recently asked how to implement time series cross-validation in R. Time series people would normally call this &amp;ldquo;forecast evaluation with a rolling origin&amp;rdquo; or something similar, but it is the natural and obvious analogue to leave-one-out cross-validation for cross-sectional data, so I prefer to call it &amp;ldquo;time series cross-validation&amp;rdquo;.Here is some example code applying time series CV and comparing 1-step, 2-step, &amp;hellip;, 12-step forecasts using the Mean Absolute Error (MAE).</description>
