      <description>This poem was written by David Goddard from the Monash University Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine. It is reproduced here with his permission. The poem won the inaugural Monash University poetry competition and will soon be published in an anthology of contemporary poetry.For those who like this sort of thing (as I do), there is a nice collection of statistical poetry here.
