      <description>In late June, I will be in New York to teach my 3-day workshop on Forecasting using R. Tickets are available at Eventbrite.
This is the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve taught this workshop in the US, having previously run it in the Netherlands and Australia. It will be based on the 2nd edition of my book &amp;ldquo;Forecasting: Principles and Practice&amp;rdquo; with George Athanasopoulos. All participants will get a print version of the book.</description>

      <description>The latest version of the forecast package for R is now on CRAN. This is the version used in the 2nd edition of my forecasting textbook with George Athanasopoulos. So readers should now be able to replicate all examples in the book using only CRAN packages.
A few new features of the forecast package may be of interest. A more complete Changelog is also available.

      <description>Prediction competitions are now so widespread that it is often forgotten how controversial they were when first held, and how influential they have been over the years.
To keep this exercise manageable, I will restrict attention to time series forecasting competitions &amp;mdash; where only the history of the data is available when producing forecasts.
Nottingham studies The earliest non-trivial study of time series forecast accuracy was probably by David Reid as part of his PhD at the University of Nottingham (1969).</description>

      <description>The M4 forecasting competition is well under-way, and a few of my PhD students have been working on submissions.
Pablo Montero-Manso, Carla Netto, and Thiyanga Talagala have made an R package containing all of the data (100,000 time series), which should make it substantially easier for other contestants to load the data into R in order to compute forecasts.
Grab the package from this github repository.

      <description>The official guidelines for the M4 competition have now been published, and there have been several developments since my last post on this.
 There is now a prize for prediction interval accuracy using a scaled version of the Mean Interval Score. If the $100(1-\alpha)$% prediction interval for time $t$ is given by $[L_{t},U_{t}]$, for $t=1,\dots,h$, then the MIS is defined as $$\frac{1}{h}\sum_{t=1}^{h} \left[ (U_t-L_t) + \frac{2}{\alpha}(L_t-Y_t)1(Y_t &amp;lt; L_t) + \frac{2}{\alpha}(Y_t-U_t)1(Y_t &amp;gt; U_t) \right] $$ where $Y_t$ is the observation at time $t$.</description>

      <description>This week I have finished preliminary versions of two new R packages for time series analysis. The first (tscompdata) contains several large collections of time series that have been used in forecasting competitions; the second (tsfeatures) is designed to compute features from univariate time series data. For now, both are only on github. I will probably submit them to CRAN after they’ve been tested by a few more people.
tscompdata There are already two packages containing forecasting competition data: Mcomp (containing the M and M3 competition data) and Tcomp (containing the tourism competition data).</description>

      <description>Following my post on the M4 competition yesterday, Spyros Makridakis sent me these comments for posting here.
I would like to thank Rob, my friend and co-author, for his insightful remarks concerning the upcoming M4 competition. As Rob says, the two of us have talked a great deal about competitions and I certainly agree with him about the “ideal” forecasting competition. In this reply, I will explain why I have deviated from the “ideal”, mostly for practical reasons and to ensure higher participation.</description>

      <description>The &amp;ldquo;M&amp;rdquo; competitions organized by Spyros Makridakis have had an enormous influence on the field of forecasting. They focused attention on what models produced good forecasts, rather than on the mathematical properties of those models. For that, Spyros deserves congratulations for changing the landscape of forecasting research through this series of competitions.
Makridakis &amp;amp; Hibon, (JRSSA 1979) was the first serious attempt at a large empirical evaluation of forecast methods.</description>

      <description>For a second year running, there will be another rOpenSci OzUnconference in Australia. This one will be held in Melbourne, on 26-27 October 2017.
Unlike regular conferences, there are no talks and there is no pre-determined agenda. It brings together scientists, developers, and open data enthusiasts from academia, industry, government, and non-profit to get together for a few days to work on R-related projects. The agenda is mostly decided during the conference itself, and involves participants dividing into small groups to work on the projects of most interest to them.</description>

      <description>I’ve been using R or its predecessors for about 30 years, so I tend to I know a lot about R, but I don’t necessarily know how to use modern R tools. Lately, I’ve been teaching my students the tidyverse approach to data analysis, which means that I need to unlearn some old approaches and to re-learn them using new tools. But old dogs and new tricks…
Yesterday, I was teaching a class where I needed to extract some rows of a data set.</description>

      <description>On 26-28 September 2017, I will be running my 3-day workshop in Perth on &amp;ldquo;Forecasting: principles and practice&amp;rdquo; based on my book of the same name.
Topics to be covered include seasonality and trends, exponential smoothing, ARIMA modelling, dynamic regression and state space models, as well as forecast accuracy methods and forecast evaluation techniques such as cross-validation.
Workshop participants are expected to be familiar with basic statistical tools such as multiple regression, but no knowledge of time series or forecasting will be assumed.</description>

      <description>For the past few months I’ve been working on a new DataCamp course teaching Forecasting using R. I’m delighted that it is now available for anyone to do.
Course blurb Forecasting involves making predictions about the future. It is required in many situations such as deciding whether to build another power generation plant in the next ten years requires forecasts of future demand; scheduling staff in a call center next week requires forecasts of call volumes; stocking an inventory requires forecasts of stock requirements.</description>

      <title>Prediction intervals for NNETAR models</title>
      <link>https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/nnetar-prediction-intervals/</link>

      <guid>https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/nnetar-prediction-intervals/</guid>
      <description>The nnetar function in the forecast package for R fits a neural network model to a time series with lagged values of the time series as inputs (and possibly some other exogenous inputs). So it is a nonlinear autogressive model, and it is not possible to analytically derive prediction intervals. Therefore we use simulation.
Suppose we fit a NNETAR model to the famous Canadian lynx data:

      <title>Monthly seasonality</title>

      <guid>https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/monthly-seasonality/</guid>
      <description>I regularly get asked why I don&amp;rsquo;t consider monthly seasonality in my models for daily or sub-daily time series. For example, this recent comment on my post on seasonal periods, or this comment on my post on daily data. The fact is, I&amp;rsquo;ve never seen a time series with monthly seasonality, although that does not mean it does not exist.
Monthly seasonality is defined as a regular pattern that recurs every month in data that is observed more frequently than monthly.</description>

      <description>This website has gone through several major updates over the years. It began in 1993 as some handcrafted html files, transitioned to Joomla and later to Wordpress. Then it slowly grew into a collection of ten connected Wordpress installations that became increasingly difficult to maintain, and rather slow.
So I&amp;rsquo;ve now converted the entire site to Blogdown/Hugo. Nearly 700 pages of wordpress content have been translated to markdown. I decided to drop a few parts of the site, notably the pages for my 1998 forecasting textbook.</description>

      <description>In what is now a roughly annual event, the forecast package has been updated on CRAN with a new version, this time 8.0.
A few of the more important new features are described below.
Check residuals A common task when building forecasting models is to check that the residuals satisfy some assumptions (that they are uncorrelated, normally distributed, etc.). The new function checkresiduals makes this very easy: it produces a time plot, an ACF, a histogram with super-imposed normal curve, and does a Ljung-Box test on the residuals with appropriate number of lags and degrees of freedom.</description>

 You use an illustration of a seasonal arima model:
ARIMA(1,1,1)(1,1,1)4
I would like to simulate data from this process then fit a model… but I am unable to find any information as to how this can be conducted… if I set phi1, Phi1, theta1, and Theta1 it would be reassuring that for large n the parameters returned by Arima(foo,order=c(1,1,1),seasonal=c(1,1,1)) are in agreement…

      <guid>https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/tscv/</guid>
      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve added a couple of new functions to the forecast package for R which implement two types of cross-validation for time series.K-fold cross-validation for autoregression The first is regular k-fold cross-validation for autoregressive models. Although cross-validation is sometimes not valid for time series models, it does work for autoregressions, which includes many machine learning approaches to time series. The theoretical background is provided in Bergmeir, Hyndman and Koo (2015). So cross-validation can be applied to any model where the predictors are lagged values of the response variable.</description>

      <description>Someone sent me some questions by email, and I decided to answer some of them here. How important is it that I know and understand the underlying mathematical framework to forecasting methods? I understand conceptually how most of them work, but I feel as if I may benefit from truly understanding the math.
 The main benefit of understanding the mathematics behind different forecasting models is to be able to adapt the models when they don&amp;rsquo;t work well for your data.</description>

      <guid>https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/forecast-intervals-for-aggregates/</guid>
      <description>A common problem is to forecast the aggregate of several time periods of data, using a model fitted to the disaggregated data. For example, you may have monthly data but wish to forecast the total for the next year. Or you may have weekly data, and want to forecast the total for the next four weeks.
If the point forecasts are means, then adding them up will give a good estimate of the total.</description>

Plotting time series with ggplot2 You can now facet a time series plot like this:
library(forecast) library(ggplot2) lungDeaths &amp;lt;- cbind(mdeaths, fdeaths) autoplot(lungDeaths, facets=TRUE) So autoplot.mts now behaves similarly to plot.mts
 Multi-step fitted values The fitted function has a new argument h to allow computation of in-sample fitted values of more than one-step-ahead. In time series, fitted values are defined as the one-step-forecasts of the data used in training a model.</description>

      <title>R packages for forecast combinations</title>
      <link>https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/forecast-combinations/</link>

      <description>It has been well-known since at least 1969, when Bates and Granger wrote their famous paper on “The Combination of Forecasts”, that combining forecasts often leads to better forecast accuracy.
So it is helpful to have a couple of new R packages which do just that: opera and forecastHybrid.
opera Opera stands for “Online Prediction by ExpeRt Aggregation”. It was written by Pierre Gaillard and Yannig Goude, and Pierre provides a nice introduction in the vignette.</description>

      <description>This is only directly relevant to my Monash students and colleagues, but the same idea might be useful for adapting to other institutions.
Some recent changes in the rmarkdown and bookdown packages mean that it is now possible to produce working papers in exactly the same format as we previously used with LaTeX.Just install the MonashEBSTemplates package from github. You also need a recent version of LaTeX.
Then from within RStudio, create a new document by selecting &amp;ldquo;Rmarkdown&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;From Template&amp;rdquo;, and select &amp;ldquo;Monash EBS Working Paper&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <title>The thief package for R: Temporal HIErarchical Forecasting</title>

      <description>I have a new R package available to do temporal hierarchical forecasting, based on my paper with George Athanasopoulos, Nikolaos Kourentzes and Fotios Petropoulos. (Guess the odd guy out there!)
It is called “thief” - an acronym for Temporal HIErarchical Forecasting. The idea is to take a seasonal time series, and compute all possible temporal aggregations that result in an integer number of observations per year. For example, a quarterly time series is aggregated to biannual and annual; while a monthly time series is aggregated to 2-monthly, quarterly, 4-monthly, biannual and annual.</description>

This post briefly summarizes the remaining new features of forecast v7. library(forecast) library(ggplot2) tslm rewritten The tslm function is designed to fit linear models to time series data. It is intended to approximately mimic lm (and calls lm to do the estimation), but to package the output to remember the ts attributes.</description>

Di and I are two of the authors of the new eechidna package for R, now on CRAN.The eechidna package has just been posted on CRAN, in time for the longest election campaign in Australia since the 1950s. The next Federal election scheduled for 2nd July was announced a few weeks ago. A little before this a handful of academics met at the first ever Australian ROpenSci Unnconference at the Microsoft headquarters in Brisbane in an event primarily organised by students at the Queensland University of Technology.</description>

      <description>Version 7 of the forecast package was released on CRAN about a month ago, but I’m only just getting around to posting about the new features.
The most visible feature was the introduction of ggplot2 graphics. I first wrote the forecast package before ggplot2 existed, and so only base graphics were available. But I figured it was time to modernize and use the nice features available from ggplot2. The following examples illustrate the main new graphical functionality.</description>

So what happened in 2006 to suddenly increase the citations? I think it was a combination of things: I wrote a new quantile() function (with Ivan Frohne) which made it into R core v2.</description>

      <description>I often see figures with two sets of prediction intervals plotted on the same graph using different line types to distinguish them. The results are almost always unreadable. A better way to do this is to use semi-transparent shaded regions. Here is an example showing two sets of forecasts for the Nile River flow.

 I wanted to ask you about your R forecast package, in particular the Arima() function. We are using this function to fit an ARIMAX model and produce model estimates and standard errors, which in turn can be used to get p-values and later model forecasts. To double check our work, we are also fitting the same model in SAS using PROC ARIMA and comparing model coefficients and output.</description>

      <description>RStudio has been a life-changer for the way I work, and for how I teach data analysis. I still have a couple of minor frustrations with it, but they are slowly disappearing as RStudio adds features.
I use dual monitors and I like to code on one monitor and have the console and plots on the other monitor. Otherwise I see too little context, and long lines get wrapped making the code harder to read.</description>

Note the downloads figure: 264K/month. I know the package is popular, but that seems crazy. Also, the downloads figure on github only counts the downloads from the RStudio mirror, and ignores downloads from the other 125 mirrors around the world.Here are the top ten downloaded packages from the last month:

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been having discussions with colleagues and university administration about the best way for universities to manage home-grown software.
The traditional business model for software is that we build software and sell it to everyone willing to pay. Very often, that leads to a software company spin-off that has little or nothing to do with the university that nurtured the development. Think MATLAB, S-Plus, Minitab, SAS and SPSS, all of which grew out of universities or research institutions.</description>

Let \(y_t\) denote the value of the time series at time \(t\), and suppose we wish to fit a trend with correlated errors of the form  \[ y_t = f(t) + n_t, \]
 where \(f(t)\) represents the possibly nonlinear trend and \(n_t\) is an autocorrelated error process.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m back in California for the next couple of weeks, and will give the following talk at Stanford and UC-Davis.
Optimal forecast reconciliation for big time series data Time series can often be naturally disaggregated in a hierarchical or grouped structure. For example, a manufacturing company can disaggregate total demand for their products by country of sale, retail outlet, product type, package size, and so on. As a result, there can be millions of individual time series to forecast at the most disaggregated level, plus additional series to forecast at higher levels of aggregation.</description>

      <description>I’ve always struggled with using plotmath via the expression function in R for adding mathematical notation to axes or legends.

So I am very happy to see the new latex2exp package available which translates LaTeX expressions into a form suitable for R graphs.</description>

      <description>Every now and then a commercial software vendor makes claims on social media about how their software is so much better than the forecast package for R, but no details are provided.
There are lots of reasons why you might select a particular software solution, and R isn&amp;rsquo;t for everyone. But anyone claiming superiority should at least provide some evidence rather than make unsubstantiated claims.The M3 forecasting competition was organized by Spyros Makridakis and Michèle Hibon.</description>

      <title>A new R package for detecting unusual time series</title>
      <link>https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/anomalous/</link>

      <description>The anomalous package provides some tools to detect unusual time series in a large collection of time series. This is joint work with Earo Wang (an honours student at Monash) and Nikolay Laptev (from Yahoo Labs). Yahoo is interested in detecting unusual patterns in server metrics. The package is based on this paper with Earo and Nikolay.
The basic idea is to measure a range of features of the time series (such as strength of seasonality, an index of spikiness, first order autocorrelation, etc.</description>

      <description>This week I uploaded a new version of the forecast package to CRAN. As there were a lot of changes, I decided to increase the version number to 6.0.
The changes are all outlined in the ChangeLog file as usual. I will highlight some of the more important changes since v5.0 here.ETS One of the most used functions in the package is ets() and it provides a stock forecasting engine for many organizations.</description>

      <description>It is now exactly 12 months since the print version of my forecasting textbook with George Athanasopoulos was released on Amazon.com. Although the book is freely available online, it seems that a lot of people still like to buy print books.It&amp;rsquo;s nice to see that it has been getting some good reviews. It is rated 4.6 stars on Amazon.com with 6 out of 8 reviewers giving it 5 stars (the 3 reviewers on Amazon.</description>

      <description>Yahoo Labs has just released an interesting new data set useful for research on detecting anomalies (or outliers) in time series data. There are many contexts in which anomaly detection is important. For Yahoo, the main use case is in detecting unusual traffic on Yahoo servers.The data set comprises real traffic to Yahoo services, along with some synthetic data. There are 367 time series in the data set, each of which contains between 741 and 1680 observations recorded at regular intervals.</description>

      <description>I spend much of my day sitting in front of a screen, coding or writing. To limit the strain on my eyes, I use a dark theme as much as possible. That is, I write with light colored text on a dark background. I don&amp;rsquo;t know why this is not the default in more software as it makes a big difference after a few hours of writing.
Most of the time, I am writing using either Sublime Text, RStudio or TeXstudio.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve now resurrected the collection of research journals that I follow, and set it up as a shared collection in feedly. So anyone can easily subscribe to all of the same journals, or select a subset of them, to follow on feedly.There are about 90 journals on the list, mostly in statistics, but some from machine learning, operations research and econometrics. I excluded probability journals, and areas of application that are well outside my research interests (such as bioinformatics, psychology and pharmacology).</description>

      <description>Shu Fan and I have developed a model for electricity demand forecasting that is now widely used in Australia for long-term forecasting of peak electricity demand. It has become known as the &amp;ldquo;Monash Electricity Forecasting Model&amp;rdquo;. We have decided to release an R package that implements our model so that other people can easily use it. The package is called &amp;ldquo;MEFM&amp;rdquo; and is available on github. We will probably also put in on CRAN eventually.</description>

      <description>Last night I gave a very short talk (less than 5 minutes) at the Melbourne Analytics Charity Christmas Gala, a combined event of the Statistical Society of Australia, Data Science Melbourne, Big Data Analytics and Melbourne Users of R Network.
This is (roughly) what I said.Statisticians seem to go through regular periods of existential crisis as they worry about other groups of people who do data analysis. A common theme is: all these other people (usually computer scientists) are doing our job!</description>

      <description>The Human Mortality Database is a wonderful resource for anyone interested in demographic data. It is a carefully curated collection of high quality deaths and population data from 37 countries, all in a consistent format with consistent definitions. I have used it many times and never cease to be amazed at the care taken to maintain such a great resource.
The data are continually being revised and updated. Today the Australian data has been updated to 2011.</description>

      <description>This week my research group discussed Adrian Raftery’s recent paper on “Use and Communication of Probabilistic Forecasts” which provides a fascinating but brief survey of some of his work on modelling and communicating uncertain futures. Coincidentally, today I was also sent a copy of David Spiegelhalter’s paper on “Visualizing Uncertainty About the Future”. Both are well-worth reading.
It made me think about my own efforts to communicate future uncertainty through graphics.</description>

      <description>I get questions about this almost every week. Here is an example from a recent comment on this blog:
 I have two large time series data. One is separated by seconds intervals and the other by minutes. The length of each time series is 180 days. I’m using R (3.1.1) for forecasting the data. I’d like to know the value of the “frequency” argument in the ts() function in R, for each data set.</description>

 Amazon is aggressively recruiting in the data sciences, and we have found that applied economists compare quite favorably with the machine learning specialists and statisticians that are sometimes recruited for such roles.</description>

      <title>Prediction intervals too narrow</title>
      <link>https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/narrow-pi/</link>

      <guid>https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/narrow-pi/</guid>
      <description>Almost all prediction intervals from time series models are too narrow. This is a well-known phenomenon and arises because they do not account for all sources of uncertainty. In my 2002 IJF paper, we measured the size of the problem by computing the actual coverage percentage of the prediction intervals on hold-out samples. We found that for ETS models, nominal 95% intervals may only provide coverage between 71% and 87%. The difference is due to missing sources of uncertainty.</description>

      <title>hts with regressors</title>

      <guid>https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/hts-with-regressors/</guid>
      <description>The hts package for R allows for forecasting hierarchical and grouped time series data. The idea is to generate forecasts for all series at all levels of aggregation without imposing the aggregation constraints, and then to reconcile the forecasts so they satisfy the aggregation constraints. (An introduction to reconciling hierarchical and grouped time series is available in this Foresight paper.)
The base forecasts can be generated using any method, with ETS models and ARIMA models provided as options in the forecast.</description>

      <guid>https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/tbats-with-regressors/</guid>
      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve received a few emails about including regression variables (i.e., covariates) in TBATS models. As TBATS models are related to ETS models, tbats() is unlikely to ever include covariates as explained here. It won&amp;rsquo;t actually complain if you include an xreg argument, but it will ignore it.
When I want to include covariates in a time series model, I tend to use auto.arima() with covariates included via the xreg argument. If the time series has multiple seasonal periods, I use Fourier terms as additional covariates.</description>

 I have just finished reading a copy of ‘Forecasting:Principles and Practice’ and I have found the book really interesting. I have particularly enjoyed the case studies and focus on practical applications.
After finishing the book I have joined a forecasting competition to put what I’ve learnt to the test. I do have a couple of queries about the forecasting outputs required. The output required is a quantile forecast, is this the same as prediction intervals?</description>

      <guid>https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/coherent-population-forecasting/</guid>
      <description>This is an example of how to use the demography package in R for stochastic population forecasting with coherent components. It is based on the papers by Hyndman and Booth (IJF 2008) and Hyndman, Booth and Yasmeen (Demography 2013). I will use Australian data from 1950 to 2009 and forecast the next 50 years.
In demography, &amp;ldquo;coherent&amp;rdquo; forecasts are where male and females (or other sub-groups) do not diverge over time.</description>

      <description>When modelling data with ARIMA models, it is sometimes useful to plot the inverse characteristic roots. The following functions will compute and plot the inverse roots for any fitted ARIMA model (including seasonal models).# Compute AR roots arroots &amp;lt;- function(object) { if(!(&amp;quot;Arima&amp;quot; %in% class(object)) &amp;amp; !(&amp;quot;ar&amp;quot; %in% class(object))) stop(&amp;quot;object must be of class Arima or ar&amp;quot;) if(&amp;quot;Arima&amp;quot; %in% class(object)) parvec &amp;lt;- object$model$phi else parvec &amp;lt;- object$ar if(length(parvec) &amp;gt; 0) { last.</description>

      <description>Rolling forecasts are commonly used to compare time series models. Here are a few of the ways they can be computed using R. I will use ARIMA models as a vehicle of illustration, but the code can easily be adapted to other univariate time series models.One-step forecasts without re-estimation The simplest approach is to estimate the model on a single set of training data, and then compute one-step forecasts on the remaining test data.</description>

      <description>Last week my research group discussed Hal Varian&amp;rsquo;s interesting new paper on &amp;ldquo;Big data: new tricks for econometrics&amp;rdquo;, Journal of Economic Perspectives, 28(2): 3-28.
It&amp;rsquo;s a nice introduction to trees, bagging and forests, plus a very brief entree to the LASSO and the elastic net, and to slab and spike regression. Not enough to be able to use them, but ok if you&amp;rsquo;ve no idea what they are. It was more disappointing on boosting (completely ignoring the fact that boosting can be applied in a regression context as well as a classification context), and his comments on causality seemed curiously naive.</description>

      <description>With the latest version of the hts package for R, it is now possible to specify rather complicated grouping structures relatively easily.
All aggregation structures can be represented as hierarchies or as cross-products of hierarchies. For example, a hierarchical time series may be based on geography: country, state, region, store. Often there is also a separate product hierarchy: product groups, product types, packet size. Forecasts of all the different types of aggregation are required; e.</description>

      <description>Today&amp;rsquo;s email question:
 I work within a government budget office and sometimes have to forecast fairly simple time series several quarters into the future. Auto.arima() works great and I often get something along the lines of: ARIMA(0,0,1)(1,1,0)[12] with drift as the lowest AICc.
However, my boss (who does not use R) takes issue with low-order AR and MA because &amp;ldquo;you&amp;rsquo;re essentially using forecasted data to make your forecast.&amp;rdquo; His models include AR(10) MA(12)s etc.</description>

      <description>There are several other blogs on forecasting that readers might be interested in. Here are seven worth following:
 No Hesitations by Francis Diebold (Professor of Economics, University of Pennsylvania). Diebold needs no introduction to forecasters. He primarily covers forecasting in economics and finance, but also xkcd cartoons, graphics, research issues, etc.
 Econometrics Beat by Dave Giles. Dave is a professor of economics at the University of Victoria (Canada), formerly from my own department at Monash University (Australia), and a native New Zealander.</description>

      <description>The MAPE (mean absolute percentage error) is a popular measure for forecast accuracy and is defined as $$ \text{MAPE} = 100\text{mean}(|y_t - \hat{y}_t|/|y_t|) $$ where $y_t$ denotes an observation and $\hat{y}_t$ denotes its forecast, and the mean is taken over $t$.
Armstrong (1985, p.348) was the first (to my knowledge) to point out the asymmetry of the MAPE saying that &amp;ldquo;it has a bias favoring estimates that are below the actual values&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>The leave-one-out cross-validation statistic is given by
 $$ \text{CV} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N e_{[i]}^2, $$  where ${e_{[i]} = y_{i} - \hat{y}_{[i]}} $, the observations are given by $y_{1},\dots,y_{N}$, and $\hat{y}_{[i]}$ is the predicted value obtained when the model is estimated with the $i\text{th}$ case deleted. This is also sometimes known as the PRESS (Prediction Residual Sum of Squares) statistic.
It turns out that for linear models, we do not actually have to estimate the model $N$ times, once for each omitted case.</description>

      <description>This is another situation where Fourier terms are useful for handling the seasonality. Not only is the seasonal period rather long, it is non-integer (averaging 365.25/7 = 52.18). So ARIMA and ETS models do not tend to give good results, even with a period of 52 as an approximation.
Regression with ARIMA errors The simplest approach is a regression with ARIMA errors. Here is an example using weekly data on US finished motor gasoline products supplied (in thousands of barrels per day) from February 1991 to May 2005.</description>

      <description>Following my post on fitting models to long time series, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d tackle the opposite problem, which is more common in business environments.
I often get asked how few data points can be used to fit a time series model. As with almost all sample size questions, there is no easy answer. It depends on the number of model parameters to be estimated and the amount of randomness in the data.</description>

      <guid>https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/backtransforming/</guid>
      <description>Many functions in the forecast package for R will allow a Box-Cox transformation. The models are fitted to the transformed data and the forecasts and prediction intervals are back-transformed. This preserves the coverage of the prediction intervals, and the back-transformed point forecast can be considered the median of the forecast densities (assuming the forecast densities on the transformed scale are symmetric). For many purposes, this is acceptable, but occasionally the mean forecast is required.</description>

      <description>It is common to want forecasts to be positive, or to require them to be within some specified range \([a,b]\). Both of these situations are relatively easy to handle using transformations.Positive forecasts To impose a positivity constraint, simply work on the log scale. With the forecast package in R, this can be handled by specifying the Box-Cox parameter \(\lambda=0\). For example, consider the real price of a dozen eggs (1900-1993; in cents):</description>

      <description>Sometimes it is useful to “backcast” a time series — that is, forecast in reverse time. Although there are no in-built R functions to do this, it is very easy to implement. Suppose x is our time series and we want to backcast for \(h\) periods. Here is some code that should work for most univariate time series. The example is non-seasonal, but the code will also work with seasonal data.</description>

The speed-up is due to some new research I am doing with Alan Lee (University of Auckland).</description>

I like it because it is written using the language and perspective of statistics, and provides a very useful entry point into the literature of machine learning which has its own terminology for statistical concepts. A free downloadable pdf version is available on the website.</description>

      <description>There is no shortage of time series data available on the web for use in student projects, or self-learning, or to test out new forecasting algorithms. It is now relatively easy to access these data sets directly in R.M Competition data The 1001 series from the M-competition and the 3003 series from the M3-competition are available as part of the Mcomp package in R.
DataMarket and Quandl Both DataMarket and Quandl contain many thousands of time series that can be downloaded directly into R.</description>

      <description>Last week, version 5.0 of the forecast package for R was released. There are a few new functions and changes made to the package, which is why I increased the version number to 5.0. Thanks to Earo Wang for helping with this new version.
Handling missing values and outliers Data cleaning is often the first step that data scientists and analysts take to ensure statistical modelling is supported by good data.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is common to use a Ljung-Box test to check that the residuals from a time series model resemble white noise. However, there is very little practical advice around about how to choose the number of lags for the test.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Estimating a nonlinear time series model in R</title>

      <guid>https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/nlts/</guid>
      <description>There are quite a few R packages available for nonlinear time series analysis, but sometimes you need to code your own models. Here is a simple example to show how it can be done.
The model is a first order threshold autoregression:
 $$ y_t = \begin{cases} \alpha y_{t-1} + e_t &amp; \text{if $y_{t-1} \le r$}\\ \beta y_{t-1} + \gamma e_t &amp; \text{if $y_{t-1}r$} \end{cases} $$  where $e_t$ is a Gaussian white noise series with variance $\sigma^2$.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve had several emails recently asking how to forecast daily data in R. Unless the time series is very long, the easiest approach is to simply set the frequency attribute to 7.
y &amp;lt;- ts(x, frequency=7)  Then any of the usual time series forecasting methods should produce reasonable forecasts. For example
library(forecast) fit &amp;lt;- ets(y) fc &amp;lt;- forecast(fit) plot(fc)  When the time series is long enough to take in more than a year, then it may be necessary to allow for annual seasonality as well as weekly seasonality.</description>

      <description>This week I&amp;rsquo;ve been at the R Users conference in Albacete, Spain. These conferences are a little unusual in that they are not really about research, unlike most conferences I attend. They provide a place for people to discuss and exchange ideas on how R can be used.
Here are some thoughts and highlights of the conference, in no particular order. Håvard Rue spoke on Bayesian computing with INLA and the R-INLA package.</description>

      <description>Akaike&amp;rsquo;s Information Criterion (AIC) is a very useful model selection tool, but it is not as well understood as it should be. I frequently read papers, or hear talks, which demonstrate misunderstandings or misuse of this important tool. The following points should clarify some aspects of the AIC, and hopefully reduce its misuse. The AIC is a penalized likelihood, and so it requires the likelihood to be maximized before it can be calculated.</description>

      <guid>https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/forecasting-annual-totals/</guid>
      <description>This question was posed on crossvalidated.com:
 I have a monthly time series (for 2009-2012 non-stationary, with seasonality). I can use ARIMA (or ETS) to obtain point and interval forecasts for each month of 2013, but I am interested in forecasting the total for the whole year, including prediction intervals. Is there an easy way in R to obtain interval forecasts for the total for 2013?
 I&amp;rsquo;ve come across this problem before in my consulting work, although I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ve ever published my solution.</description>

In reality, an online book is never complete, and we plan to continually update it. But it is now at the point where it is suitable for course work, and contains exercises and references.
We hope that users (especially other lecturers) will submit materials such as slides and exercises, that can be shared on the website.</description>

      <description>When I want to insert figures generated in R into a LaTeX document, it looks better if I first remove the white space around the figure. Unfortunately, R does not make this easy as the graphs are generated to look good on a screen, not in a document.
There are two things that can be done to fix this problem.First, you can reduce the white space generated by R. I use the following function when saving figures in R.</description>

      <description>It is common to fit a model using training data, and then to evaluate its performance on a test data set. When the data are time series, it is useful to compute one-step forecasts on the test data. For some reason, this is much more commonly done by people trained in machine learning rather than statistics.
If you are using the forecast package in R, it is easily done with ETS and ARIMA models.</description>

 I have looked but cannot find any info on generating forecasts on multiple data sets in sequence. I have been using analysis services for sql server to generate fitted time series but it is too much of a black box (or I don’t know enough to tweak/manage the inputs). In short, what package should I research that will allow me to load data, generate a forecast (presumably best fit), export the forecast then repeat for a few thousand items.</description>

So for the record, here are the most important changes to the forecast package made since v3.0 was released.</description>

Make is a marvellous tool used by programmers to build software, but it can be used for much more than that. I use make whenever I have a large project involving R files and LaTeX files, which means I use it for almost all of the papers I write, and almost of the consulting reports I produce.If you are using a Mac or Linux, you will already have make installed.</description>

      <description>Forecasters are often met with skepticism. Almost every time I tell someone that I work in forecasting, they say something about forecasting the stock market, or forecasting the weather, usually suggesting that such forecasts are hopelessly inaccurate. In fact, forecasts of the weather are amazingly accurate given the complexity of the system, while anyone claiming to forecast the stock market deserves skepticism. So what is the difference between these two types of forecasts, and can we say anything about what can be reasonably be forecast and what can&amp;rsquo;t?</description>

Stephen Pollock: Don&amp;rsquo;t imagine your model is the truth Actually, Stephen said something like &amp;ldquo;economists (or was it econometricians?) have a bad habit of imagining their models are true&amp;rdquo;. He gave the example of people asking whether GDP &amp;ldquo;has a unit root&amp;rdquo;?</description>

      <description>About once a week someone will tell me there is a bug in my forecast package for R because it gives forecasts that are the same for all future horizons. To save answering the same question repeatedly, here is my response.
A point forecast is (usually) the mean of the distribution of a future observation in the time series, conditional on the past observations of the time series. It is possible, even likely in some circumstances, that the future observations will have the same mean and then the forecast function is flat.</description>

A non-seasonal ARIMA model can be written as \begin{equation}\label{eq:c} (1-\phi_1B - \cdots - \phi_p B^p)(1-B)^d y_t = c + (1 + \theta_1 B + \cdots + \theta_q B^q)e_t \end{equation} or equivalently as \begin{equation}\label{eq:mu} (1-\phi_1B - \cdots - \phi_p B^p)(1-B)^d (y_t - \mu t^d/d!) = (1 + \theta_1 B + \cdots + \theta_q B^q)e_t, \end{equation} where $B$ is the backshift operator, $c = \mu(1-\phi_1 - \cdots - \phi_p )$ and $\mu$ is the mean of $(1-B)^d y_t$.</description>

      <description>I have thought quite a lot about including regressors (i.e. covariates) in exponential smoothing (ETS) models, and I have done it a couple of times in my published work. See my 2008 exponential smoothing book (chapter 9) and my 2008 Tourism Management paper. However, there are some theoretical issues with these approaches, which have come to light through the research of Ahmad Farid Osman, one of our PhD students at Monash University.</description>

      <description>I received the following email today:
 I am preparing a thesis &amp;hellip; I need to conduct the widest possible poll, and it occurred to me that perhaps you could guide me toward an internet-based way in which this can be done easily. I have a ten-question questionnaire prepared, that I wish to have an random sample of the population respond to. I have no budget for this, so I hope you can suggest a way in which a good number of responses can be harvested using blogs or sites you may be aware of.</description>

      <description>I gave this talk on Forecasting time series using R for the Melbourne Users of R Network (MelbURN) on Thursday 27 October 2011.
Slides Examples
Abstract I look at the various facilities for time series forecasting available in R, concentrating on the forecast package. This package implements several automatic methods for forecasting time series including forecasts from ARIMA models, ARFIMA models and exponential smoothing models. I also look more generally at how to go about forecasting non-seasonal data, seasonal data, seasonal data with high frequency, and seasonal data with multiple frequencies.</description>

      <description>This is a gem of a book. It will become the book I give PhD students when they are learning how to write good R code. That is, if I ever see it again. I had hoped to write a review of it, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen it since it arrived in the mail a couple of weeks ago because a research student or research assistant has always had it on loan.</description>

      <description>I asked my research group recently what they wished they had learned before they started work on a PhD. Here are some of the responses. More mathematics. Particular topics they named included real analysis, functional analysis, measure theory, algebra, linear algebra. That would have been my response also. I still wish I knew more mathematics than I do. I did quite a lot of mathematics as an undergraduate, but every year I need to learn some more.</description>

      <description>I was recently asked how to implement time series cross-validation in R. Time series people would normally call this &amp;ldquo;forecast evaluation with a rolling origin&amp;rdquo; or something similar, but it is the natural and obvious analogue to leave-one-out cross-validation for cross-sectional data, so I prefer to call it &amp;ldquo;time series cross-validation&amp;rdquo;.Here is some example code applying time series CV and comparing 1-step, 2-step, &amp;hellip;, 12-step forecasts using the Mean Absolute Error (MAE).</description>

      <description>The forecast package for R has undergone a major upgrade, and I&amp;rsquo;ve given it version number 3 as a result. Some of these changes were suggestions from the forecasting workshop I ran in Switzerland a couple of months ago, and some have been on the drawing board for a long time. Here are the main changes in version 3, plus a few earlier additions that I thought deserved a mention.</description>

      <description>I received this email today:
 I have a question about the ets() function in R, which I am trying to use for Holt-Winters exponential smoothing. My problem is that I am getting very different estimates of the alpha, beta and gamma parameters using ets() compared to HoltWinters(), and I can&amp;rsquo;t figure out why.
 This is a common question, so I thought the answer might be of sufficient interest to post here.</description>

      <description>I received an email today with the following comment:
 I’m using ARIMA with Intervention detection and was planning to use your package to identify my initial ARIMA model for later iteration, however I found that sometimes the auto.arima function returns a model where AR/MA coefficients are not significant. So my question is: Is there a way to filter the search for ARIMA models that only have significant coefficients. I can remove the non-significant coefficients but I think it would be better to search for those models that only have significant coefficients.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve tried Tinn-R, NppToR, Eclipse with StatET and a couple of other editors, but nothing was quite right.
Then yesterday, out of the blue, RStudio was announced and it looks fantastic! A screenshot is given below.

The window contains a smart editor with code completion and tabbing, console, workspace with viewable objects, plotting panel with history, etc.</description>

      <description>The Holt-Winters method is a popular and effective approach to forecasting seasonal time series. But different implementations will give different forecasts, depending on how the method is initialized and how the smoothing parameters are selected. In this post I will discuss various initialization methods.
Suppose the time series is denoted by $y_1,\dots,y_n$ and the seasonal period is $m$ (e.g., $m=12$ for monthly data). Let $\hat{y}_{t+h|t}$ be the $h$-step forecast made using data to time $t$.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve had a few emails lately about forecast evaluation and estimation criteria. Here is one I received today, along with some comments.
 I have a rather simple question regarding the use of MSE as opposed to MAD and MAPE. If the parameters of a time series model are estimated by minimizing MSE, why do we evaluate the model using some other metric, e.g., MAD and MAPE. I could see that MAPE is not scale dependent.</description>

 I use Eviews to estimate time series, but I have been checking out R recently, and your Forecast package.
I cannot understand why 2 similar equations in Eviews and R are giving different estimated output. Your insights will be invaluable for my work.
The equations are:
 R: Arima(log(fee), order=c(1,1,0), seasonal=list(order=c(1,0,0), period=4), include.drift=TRUE) Eviews: dlog(fee) c ar(1) sar(1)  Even with include.</description>

      <description>The United Nations has declared today &amp;ldquo;World Statistics Day&amp;rdquo;. I&amp;rsquo;ve no idea what that means, or why we need a WSD. Perhaps it is because the date is 20.10.2010 (except in North America where it is 10.20.2010). But then, what happens from 2013 to 2099? And do we just forget the whole idea after 3112?
In any case, if we are going to have a WSD, let&amp;rsquo;s use it to do something useful.</description>

      <description>This was the topic of a recent conversation on the Australian and New Zealand R mailing list. Here is an edited list of some of the comments made.
 R is free.
 R is well-documented.
 R runs (really well) on *nix as well as Windows and Mac OS.
 R is open-source. Trust in the R software is evident by its support among distinguished statisticians. However, the R user need not rely on trust, as the source code for R is freely available for public scrutiny.</description>

      <description>There is often confusion about how to include covariates in ARIMA models, and the presentation of the subject in various textbooks and in R help files has not helped the confusion. So I thought I&amp;rsquo;d give my take on the issue. To keep it simple, I will only describe non-seasonal ARIMA models although the ideas are easily extended to include seasonal terms. I will include only one covariate in the models although it is easy to extend the results to multiple covariates.</description>

      <guid>https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/longseasonality/</guid>
      <description>I am often asked how to fit an ARIMA or ETS model with data having a long seasonal period such as 365 for daily data or 48 for half-hourly data. Generally, seasonal versions of ARIMA and ETS models are designed for shorter periods such as 12 for monthly data or 4 for quarterly data.
The ets() function in the forecast package restricts seasonality to be a maximum period of 24 to allow hourly data but not data with a larger seasonal frequency.</description>

A useful on-line and free resource is &amp;ldquo;Econometrics in R&amp;rdquo; by Grant Farnsworth. It covers some common econometric methods including heteroskedasticity in regression, probit and logit models, tobit regression, and quantile regression.</description>

The idea presented there is to break the code into four files, all stored in your project directory. These four files are to be processed in the following order.
 load.R This file includes all code associated with loading the data. Usually, it will be a short file reading in data from files.</description>

      <description>Suppose you want a function to fit a neural network. What&amp;rsquo;s the best way to find it? Here are three steps that help to find the elusive function relatively quickly.
First, use help.search(&amp;quot;neural&amp;quot;) or the shorthand ??neural. This will search the help files of installed packages for the word &amp;ldquo;neural&amp;rdquo;. Actually, fuzzy matching is used so it returns pages that have words similar to &amp;ldquo;neural&amp;rdquo; such as &amp;ldquo;natural&amp;rdquo;. For a stricter search, use help.</description>

      <title>R help on StackOverflow</title>

      <description>Ever since I began using R about ten years ago, the best place to find R help was on the R-help mailing list. But it is time-consuming searching through the archives trying to find something from a long time ago, and there is no way to sort out the good advice from the bad advice.
But now there is a new tool and it is very neat. Head over to the R tag on StackOverflow.</description>

      <description>There is now an official CRAN Task View for Time Series. This will replace my earlier list of time series packages for R, and provide a more visible and useful entry point for people wanting to use R for time series analysis. If I have missed anything on the list, please let me know.</description>

      <title>Organization and R</title>

      <description>Many R users seem to get themselves in a bit of a mess with R files and workspaces scattered across different directories. The R files themselves also get messy and hard to follow. So here is some advice on keeping organized with R:
 Try to keep code strictly indented based on the code structure such as loops, if statements, etc. Every left brace { should be followed by an extra level of indentation which continues until the matching right brace }.</description>

      <description>Anyone who starts writing serious R code (i.e., code that involves user-written functions) soon finds the need to use debugging tools. There are a few basic tools in R that are worth knowing about.
The function debug() allows one to step through the execution of a function, line by line. At any point, you can print out values of variables or produce a graph of the results within the function. While debugging, you can simply type &amp;ldquo;c&amp;rdquo; to continue to the end of the current section of code (e.</description>
