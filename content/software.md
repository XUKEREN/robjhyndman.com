This page provides links to R packages I have written. The most recent versions of most packages are [on github](https://github.com/robjhyndman/). Most packages are also [on CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com).


[**addb**](http://pkg.robjhyndman.com/addb/)
:  Nine data sets, taken from the Australian Demographic Data Bank version 3.2b, courtesy of [Len Smith](mailto:leonard.smith@anu.edu.au).

: Automatic identification of breaks for additive season and trend, designed for use with remote sensing data. [[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=bfast)]

[**demography**](https://github.com/robjhyndman/demography)
: Provides a large number of functions for handling demographic statistics, modelling and forecasting. In particular, it implements lifetable calculations; Lee-Carter modelling and variants; functional data analysis of mortality rates, fertility rates, net migration numbers; and stochastic population forecasting.

[[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=eechidna)]

[**emma**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=emma/)
: The evolutionary model-based multiresponse approach (EMMA) is a novel methodology to process optimisation and product improvement. The approach is suitable to contexts in which the experimental cost and/or time limit the number of implementable trials. [[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=emma)]

[**expsmooth**](http://pkg.robjhyndman.com/expsmooth/)
: Data sets from [Hyndman, Koehler, Ord and Snyder (2008) *Forecasting with exponential smoothing: the state space approach*, Springer: Berlin.](http://www.exponentialsmoothing.net/) [[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=expsmooth)]

[**fds**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=fds)
: Functional data sets useful for testing new methods. [[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=fds)]

[**fma**](http://pkg.robjhyndman.com/fma/)
: Data sets from [Makridakis, Wheelwright and Hyndman (1998) *Forecasting: methods and applications*, Wiley &amp; Sons: New York.](https://robjhyndman.com/forecasting/) [[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=fma)]

[**forecast**](http://pkg.robjhyndman.com/forecast/)
: Methods and tools for displaying and analysing univariate time series forecasts including exponential smoothing via state space models and automatic ARIMA modelling. [[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=forecast)]

[**fpp**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=fpp)
: Data sets from [Hyndman & Athanasopoulos (2014) *Forecasting: principles and practice*, OTexts: Melbourne](http://www.otexts.org/fpp). [[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=fpp)]

[**fpp2**](https://github.com/robjhyndman/fpp/)
: Data sets from [Hyndman & Athanasopoulos (2017) *Forecasting: principles and practice*, 2nd edition, OTexts: Melbourne](http://www.otexts.org/fpp2). [[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=fpp2)]

[**ftsa**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ftsa)
: Methods and tools for modelling and forecasting functional time series. [[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ftsa)]

[**hdrcde**](http://pkg.robjhyndman.com/hdrcde/)
: Tools for the computation of highest density regions in one and two dimensions, kernel estimation of univariate density functions conditional on one covariate, and multimodal regression. [[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=hdrcde)]

[**hts**](http://pkg.earo.me/hts/)
: Methods for visualizing, analysing and forecasting hierarchical time series. [[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=hts)]

[**Mcomp**](http://pkg.robjhyndman.com/Mcomp)
: The 1001 time series from the M-competition (Makridakis et al. 1982) and the 3003 time series from the IJF-M3 competition (Makridakis and Hibon, 2000). [[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Mcomp)]

[**MEFM**](https://github.com/robjhyndman/mefm-package)
: A set of tools for implementing the Monash Electricity Forecasting Model based on the paper by [Hyndman and Fan (2010)](https://robjhyndman.com/publications/peak-electricity-demand/).

[**ozdata**](https://github.com/AU-BURGr/ozdata)
: Tools to import and explore Australian data sets. Data imported from [data.gov.au](https://data.gov.au) and [ausmacrodata.org](http://ausmacrodata.org).

[**rainbow**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rainbow)
: Plots for functional data: rainbow plot, functional bagplot, functional HDR boxplot. [[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rainbow)]

[**smoothAPC**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=smoothAPC)
: Smoothing demographic data with period and cohort effects. The method uses bivariate thin plate splines, bivariate lasso-type regularization, and allows for both period and cohort effects. Thus the mortality rates are modelled as the sum of four components: a smooth bivariate function of age and time, smooth one-dimensional cohort effects, smooth one-dimensional period effects and random errors. The methods are described in [Dokumentov, A., and Hyndman, R.J. (2014) Bivariate data with ridges: two-dimensional smoothing of mortality rates](https://robjhyndman.com/publications/mortality-smoothing/). [[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=smoothAPC)]

[**stR**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=stR)
: STR time series decomposition. The methods are described in [Dokumentov, A., and Hyndman, R.J. (2016) STR: A Seasonal-Trend Decomposition Procedure Based on Regression](https://robjhyndman.com/publications/str/). [[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=stR)]

[**sugrrants**](http://pkg.earo.me/sugrrants/)
: Supporting Graphs for Analysing Time Series. Tools for plotting temporal data using  the tidyverse and grammar of graphics framework. [[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=sugrrants)]

[**thief**](http://pkg.robjhyndman.com/thief/)
: Temporal Hierarchical Forecasting. The methods are described in [Forecasting with temporal hierarchies](https://robjhyndman.com/publications/temporal-hierarchies/), co-authored with George Athanasopoulos, Nikolaos Kourentzes and Fotios Petropoulos. [[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=thief)]
