The publishing platform I set up for my forecasting book has now been extended to cover more books and greater functionality. Check it out at [www.otexts.org](http://www.otexts.org/). 

[![](https://www.otexts.org/sites/default/files/Mainlogo.png)](http://www.otexts.org)<!-- more -->

So far, we have three complete books:



	
  1. [_Forecasting: principles and practice_, by Rob J Hyndman and George Athanasopoulos](http://www.otexts.org/book/fpp/)

  2. [_Statistical foundations of machine learning_, by Gianluca Bontempi and Souhaib Ben Taieb](https://www.otexts.org/book/sfml)

  3. [_Modal logic of strict necessity and possbibility_, by Evgeni Latinov](https://www.otexts.org/book/mlo)

and one book currently being written:

	
  4. [_Electric load forecasting: fundamentals and best practices_, by Tao Hong and David Dickey](https://www.otexts.org/book/elf)


Thanks to [Souhaib Ben Taieb](http://souhaib-bentaieb.com/) for doing a lot of the work to make OTexts a reality. I've talked about an online textbook publishing platform for several years, and so it is great to finally see it happening.

There is a lot more to come. We hope to add new books, and new features. The new features include:




  * forums for each book where readers can interact with each other and with the authors;

  * the ability to add personal highlights and notes to individual sections of a book;

  * some books available in print versions.


Please check out the new site, and if you're a potential author, [please contact us](https://www.otexts.org/about/for-authors). As you will see from what we already have online, LaTeX is no problem (we are using [MathJax](http://www.mathjax.org/) as the LaTeX renderer). But we haven't yet started making the most of the dynamic online platform by having multimedia content, interactive content, and so on. Hopefully some new authors will help us to reimagine what a modern textbook can be!
