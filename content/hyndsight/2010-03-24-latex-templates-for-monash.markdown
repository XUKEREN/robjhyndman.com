I have updated my LaTeX templates for use at Monash so they no longer depend on [HyTeX](http://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/latex-preamble/). Templates are provided for producing a working paper and a PhD thesis in the Department of Econometrics & Business Statistics at Monash University. People at other universities are welcome to adapt the templates for their own institutions.



	
  * The style files and Monash crest are provided [here](http://robjhyndman.com/research/monash.zip). This should be unzipped in a directory on the MikTeX search path; for example, in `C:\Program Files\MiKTeX 2.9\tex\latex`.

	
  * **Monash working paper**. Here is a [template](http://www.robjhyndman.com/research/wptemplate.tex). You will need to provide the working paper number (ask Elke) and some [JEL codes](http://www.aeaweb.org/jel/jel_class_system.php). See [an example of its use](/publications/brca_bw.pdf).

	
  * **Monash thesis**. Here is a [template](http://www.robjhyndman.com/research/thesis.zip). You should be able to figure the rest out yourself! Here is [an example of what it looks like](http://robjhyndman.com/research/thesis.pdf).

	
  * **Seminar slides**. Here is a [template](http://www.robjhyndman.com/research/talktemplate.tex) based on the [beamer package](http://www.ctan.org/pkg/beamer/).
