I am teaching part of a short-course on Data Science for Managers from 10-12 October in Melbourne.



### Course Overview

>The impact of Data Science on modern business is second only to the introduction of computers. And yet, for many businesses the barrier of entry remains too high due to lack of knowhow, organisational inertia, difficulties in hiring the right manpower, an apparent need for upfront commitment, and more.

>This course is designed to address these barriers, giving the necessary knowledge and skills to flesh out and manage Data Science functions within your organisation, taking the anxiety-factor out of the Big Data revolution and demonstrating how data-driven decision-making can be integrated into oneâ€™s organisation to harness existing advantages and to create new opportunities.

>Assuming minimal prior knowledge, this course provides complete coverage of the key aspects, including data wrangling, modelling and analysis, predictive-, descriptive- and prescriptive-analytics, data management and curation, standards for data storage and analysis, the use of structured, semi-structured and unstructured data as well as of open public data, and the data-analytic value chain, all covered at a fundamental level.
