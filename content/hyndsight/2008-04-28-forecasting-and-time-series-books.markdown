People often ask me for recommendations on forecasting books and time series books. So here is list of ten good books to which I often refer. (If you can't see a table showing the books below, try turning off your ad-blocker.)

Two are **my own books** of course (after all, I wrote them because I thought I had something to say). You can also get the first one online for free at [OTexts.org/fpp](http://www.otexts.org/fpp).

The book by **Ord and Fildes** is excellent, although expensive, and is more detailed than my book with George Athanasopoulos. It has particularly good coverage of the non-statistical parts of forecasting including judgemental forecasting and forecasting within organizations.

**Diebold** has a more econometric focus than the other books and so has more detailed discussion of unit roots, volatility forecasting, etc. It also discusses forecasting loss functions, which all of the other books ignore.

**Pena, Tiao and Tsay** contains chapters by different authors, and covers several topics that everyone else ignores such as different types of outliers, Bayesian analysis, nonparametric time series analysis, VARMA models, and more. It is at a higher level than the other ones listed here.

**Box, Jenkins and Reinsel** is the classic and original reference which will sadly never be updated now that all the authors have died. But it is still worth reading for its deep insights.

**Armstrong**'s "Principles of Forecasting" is by a range of different authors and the chapters are of variable quality as a result, but it is an excellent resource, especially on the non-statistical areas of forecasting.

**Brockwell and Davis**'s pink book (as distinct from their higher level yellow book) hardly mention forecasting despite the title, but their coverage of time series is very good, especially ARIMA models.

Finally, I list two books on time series using R. Both are good textbooks, and I use them, but they both have some problems with their coverage of R. **Shumway and Stoffer** ignore the R packages available on CRAN, so their coverage is very limited, and they provide some R functions in a clumsy R workspace rather than a proper package. **Cryer and Chan** also ignore the CRAN packages, and provide their own R package (TSA), but it is poorly written and I would not recommend using it.
