This is a [new competition](http://www.cros-portal.eu/content/bdcomp) being organized by EuroStat. The first phase involves nowcasting economic indicators at national and European level including unemployment, HICP, Tourism and Retail Trade and some of their variants.

The main goal of the competition is to discover promising methodologies and data sources that could, now or in the future, be used to improve the production of official statistics in the European Statistical System.

The organizers seem to have been encouraged by the success of [Kaggle](http://kaggle.com) and other data science competition platforms. Unfortunately, they have chosen not to give any prizes other than an invitation to give a conference presentation or poster, which hardly seems likely to attract many good participants.

The deadline for registration is 10 January 2016. The duration of the competition is roughly a year (including about a month for evaluation).

See the [call for participation](http://www.cros-portal.eu/content/call-participation) for more information.
