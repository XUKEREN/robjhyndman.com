This week, I made my first poster. Although I've been an academic for more than 20 years, I've never had to make a poster before. Some of my coauthors have made posters about our joint research, and two of them have even won prizes (although I can't take any credit for them). But this week, our department is displaying posters from all research staff about our recent work.

Here is my poster (click for pdf version):

It was done using beamer which turns out to be as good for posters as it is for slides. I used the [beamerposter package](http://www-i6.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/~dreuw/latexbeamerposter.php) which comes with a few themes. None of the themes were quite what I wanted, so I adapted one. [Here it is](http://robjhyndman.com/research/beamerthemeRJH.sty) in case anyone else wants to use it. I've also made a [template](http://robjhyndman.com/research/postertemplate.tex) based on the poster above.
