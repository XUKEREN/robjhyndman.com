Every two years, the _International Journal of Forecasting_ awards a prize for the best paper published in a two year period. It is now time to identify the best paper published in the IJF during 2012 and 2013. There is always about 18 months delay after the publication period to allow time for reflection, citations, etc. The prize is US$1000 plus an engraved plaque.<!-- more -->

Nominations are invited from any reader of the IJF. Each person may nominate up to three papers, but you cannot nominate a paper that you have coauthored yourself. Papers coauthored by one of the five editors (Elliott, Hyndman, Önkal, Ruiz, or van Dijk) are not eligible for the prize. All nominations are to be accompanied by a short statement (up to 200 words) from the nominator, explaining why the paper deserves an award.

You can see [all the papers published in the period 2012-2013 on Google Scholar](http://goo.gl/cwzp7z). You can also [download a spreadsheet](http://robjhyndman.com/ijf2012-2013.xlsx) containing all the papers from 2012-2013 along with the numbers of citations according to Google Scholar and Scopus. Scopus does not cover every published journal, so the citation counts are underestimates, but they give some general guide as to which papers have attracted the attention of researchers. Google Scholar includes far more citations including working papers, but there may be some double counting.

Of course, a good paper does not always get noticed, so don't let the citation count sway you too much in nominating what you consider to be the best IJF paper from this period.

Nominations should be [sent by email to me](mailto:ijf@forecasters.org?Subject=Nomination for best IJF paper 2012-2013) by 30 April 2015.
