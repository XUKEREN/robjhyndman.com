I recommend Gmail to everyone who asks, and many who don't, as it is far superior to every other email platform around. But being paranoid, I don't like all that valuable email in someone else's hands. What if Google goes bust one day? Or the Australian government's internet filter stops gmail? Or I move to China? So I need a local backup just in case. I also need the backup to be painless and not require much attention.

The solution is [Thunderbird](http://www.mozillamessaging.com/en-US/thunderbird/), but there is a bit of setting up to do at first, then you can sit back and let it do its work. [The instructions are here](http://www.matthewjmiller.net/howtos/backing-up-gmail-with-thunderbird-imap/). You need to follow them -- simply setting up Thunderbird to access your gmail is not enough as Thunderbird won't download your mail for local storage by default.

Once you've set up Thunderbird to download everything, all you need to do is open Thunderbird every few weeks and leave it to do it's stuff.

If that's too much work, you can always have Thunderbird open automatically at start up but stay [minimized to the tray](http://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/addon/2831/).
